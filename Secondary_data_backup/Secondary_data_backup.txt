3-2-1 backup rule:
1) Three Copies: The rule mandates creating at least three copies of your data. This includes the original data and at least two backup copies.
2) Two Different Storage Types:
The backups should be stored on two different types of storage media (e.g., a local hard drive and cloud storage).
3) One Off-Site Copy:
At least one copy of your data must be stored off-site (either physically or in the cloud) to protect against physical disasters or site-specific failures. 
--------------------------------------
Yes, SnapFS (Snapshot File System) is typically implemented at the kernel level, or at least with components that tightly integrate with the kernel, especially when it comes to filesystem-level snapshots.

Here's why:
Low-Level Filesystem Operations: SnapFS needs to intercept or manage low-level file operations such as reads, writes, and metadata changes. These operations occur within the kernel space, and implementing SnapFS at the kernel level ensures performance and direct access to these operations.

Snapshot Consistency: For creating consistent snapshots, SnapFS often needs access to in-memory filesystem data structures (like inodes, page caches, etc.)‚Äîwhich are only accessible from kernel space.

Filesystem Modules: If SnapFS is implemented as a new or extended filesystem (like ext4, btrfs, or ZFS), it's definitely part of the kernel as a kernel module.

Examples:

Btrfs and ZFS both support snapshots and are implemented at the kernel level.

SnapFS-like features, such as overlay filesystems (e.g., OverlayFS), are also in the kernel.

Exceptions / Variants:
There are also user-space snapshot tools (e.g., using rsync, LVM, or FUSE-based implementations), but they typically rely on kernel support or APIs to function correctly.

If you‚Äôre referring to a specific SnapFS (perhaps a project or paper with that name), feel free to share more details, and I can give a more targeted answer.

üß† Description of Components
Component	Description
SnapFS App	User-facing logic to read/write files and trigger snapshots.
Data Storage	Stores file contents on an HDD (e.g., /mnt/hdd/filename).
Metadata Store	Stores metadata (JSON format) on SSD (e.g., /mnt/ssd/filename.json).
Snapshot Manager	Handles versioning and snapshot tagging, supports incremental diffs.
Amazon S3 API	Uses AWS SDK for C++ to upload data and metadata to a configured S3 bucket.

üîÅ Typical Workflow
User writes a file through SnapFS.

File content saved to HDD.

Metadata (filename, size, hash, version, timestamp) saved to SSD.

Snapshot Manager tracks versions.

Backup to Amazon S3 is either:

Immediate (triggered on save), or

Scheduled/batched.
