🔥 Detailed Explanation of Each Category
🔶 1. Network-Based Attacks
Attacks that target the network or communication channels.

✔ DoS / DDoS (Denial of Service)
Overloads the target server to make it unavailable.

✔ MITM (Man-in-the-Middle)
Intercepts communication between two systems.

✔ Sniffing
Captures unencrypted network packets (passwords, data).

✔ Spoofing
Pretending to be someone/something else
(ex: IP spoofing, Email spoofing).

✔ Session Hijacking
Taking control of an active session (cookies stolen).

✔ DNS Poisoning
Redirects users to fake malicious websites.

🔶 2. Malware Attacks
Malicious software installed on a system.

✔ Virus
Attaches to files & spreads when the file runs.

✔ Worm
Self-spreading without user action.

✔ Trojan
A “fake” useful program that contains hidden malware.

✔ Ransomware
Encrypts files and demands money to unlock.

✔ Spyware
Steals sensitive information silently.

✔ Adware
Shows unwanted ads and tracks user behavior.

🔶 3. Human-Based (Social Engineering) Attacks
Tricks humans instead of exploiting systems.

✔ Phishing
Fake emails or messages to steal login credentials.

✔ Spear Phishing
Targeted phishing for specific individuals.

✔ Pretexting
Attacker creates a fake story to get information.

✔ Baiting
Offering something enticing (USB, downloads) to trap users.

✔ Tailgating
Entering secure areas by following authorized people.

🔶 4. Advanced Application & System Attacks
✔ Zero-Day Attack
Exploits a software vulnerability not yet known to the vendor.

✔ SQL Injection
Injecting malicious SQL commands into input fields.

✔ Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
Injects malicious scripts into trusted websites.

✔ CSRF (Cross-site Request Forgery)
Tricks a logged-in user into performing malicious actions.

✔ Password Attacks
Brute force

Dictionary attack

Credential stuffing

✔ Insider Threat
Employees intentionally or accidentally leaking data.

✔ Supply Chain Attack
Targets vendors to compromise the final organization.

It seems like I can’t do more advanced data analysis right now. Please try again later.

If you want, just tell me “generate the PDF again”, and I will retry using the Python tool to create your downloadable PDF.

ChatGPT said:
Here are the most common cyber attacks that generally occur in real-world systems. These are the attacks you are most likely to encounter or hear about regularly.

✅ Common Cyber Attacks (Real-World)
1. Phishing
Fake emails/messages trick people into revealing passwords or clicking malicious links.

Example:
"Your bank account is locked — click here to verify."

2. Malware
Any malicious software installed without user consent.

Types include:

Virus

Worm

Trojan

Ransomware

Spyware

Adware

Example:
You download a “free tool” that secretly steals data.

3. Ransomware
Encrypts your files and demands payment to unlock.

Example:
WannaCry, LockBit attacks on hospitals & companies.

4. Password Attacks
Attackers try to guess or steal passwords.

Methods:

Brute force (trying all combinations)

Dictionary attack

Credential stuffing (using leaked passwords)

5. DoS / DDoS (Denial of Service)
Attackers overload a server with traffic to make it unavailable.

Example:
Website becomes slow or unreachable due to massive requests.

6. MitM (Man-in-the-Middle)
Attacker intercepts communication between two parties.

Example:
Connecting to an unsecured WiFi network.

7. SQL Injection
Attacker injects malicious code into a website’s database query.

Example:
Login form bypass: ' OR '1'='1

8. XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)
Attacker injects malicious scripts into trusted websites.

Example:
Stealing cookies/session tokens.

9. Social Engineering
Attacks that exploit human behavior instead of technical vulnerabilities.

Includes:

Fake calls

Impersonation

Fake support agents

Tailgating into office buildings

10. Insider Threat
An internal employee/contractor misuses access intentionally or accidentally.

Example:
Employee leaking data.

11. Spoofing
Pretending to be someone else (email, IP, caller ID).

Example:
Fake emails appearing to come from CEO.

12. Zero-Day Attack
Using a vulnerability unknown to the vendor (no patch available).

13. Supply Chain Attack
Attackers compromise a vendor to reach their customers.

Example:
SolarWinds attack (affecting thousands).
