Key Cybersecurity Attacks Explained (Simple + In-Depth)
1. Phishing
What it is:
Tricking users into giving sensitive info (passwords, OTP, credit card, etc.) by pretending to be a trusted entity (bank, PayPal, HR, etc.).

How it works:
Fake emails, SMS, websites, calls
Social engineering
Links to malicious login pages

Goal: Steal credentials, spread malware, or financial fraud.
--------------------------------------
2. Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack
What it is:
An attacker secretly intercepts and possibly alters communication between two parties.

How it works:
Attacker sits between user ↔ server
Captures passwords, tokens, personal data
Can inject malicious data

Examples:
Public Wi-Fi sniffing
ARP spoofing

Fake access point
---------------------------------------
3. Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attack
What it is:
Attackers use thousands/millions of systems (botnets) to flood a server or network with traffic.

Goal:
Make the system slow or completely unavailable.

Types:
Volumetric: Huge traffic flood
Protocol attacks: SYN flood, ping flood
Application-level: HTTP flood
---------------------------------------
4. SQL Injection (SQLi)
What it is:
Attacker injects malicious SQL queries through user input fields to manipulate the database.

How it works:
If an app doesn’t sanitize inputs, attacker can:

Dump user data
Bypass login

Modify/delete database

Example:
' OR '1'='1 → Login bypass
-----------------------------
5. Zero-Day Exploit
What it is:
A vulnerability unknown to the vendor, with no patch available.

Why dangerous:
Attackers exploit it before developers even know it exists.

Examples:

Browser zero-day
OS kernel zero-day
-----------------------------
6. Ransomware
What it is:
Malware that encrypts a victim’s data and demands ransom to unlock it.

How it spreads:
Phishing
Malicious attachments
Drive-by downloads

Impact:
Data encryption
System lockout

Business downtime
----------------------------------
7. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
What it is:
Attackers inject malicious JavaScript into web pages viewed by other users.

Types:
Stored XSS (permanent)
Reflected XSS
DOM-based XSS

Goal:
Steal cookies
Hijack sessions
Inject phishing forms
----------------------------------
8. Drive-by Download
What it is:
Malware automatically downloaded to a victim’s device just by visiting a compromised website.

How it works:
Exploits browser/plugin vulnerabilities
No user interaction needed

Used for:
Installing spyware
Dropping ransomware
Gaining remote access
