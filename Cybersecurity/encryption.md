## 1️⃣ Symmetric Encryption

### What it is
- **Same secret key** is used for:
  - Encryption
  - Decryption
Sender Receiver

# Symmetric Encryption Flow

Plain Data  
│  
│ Encrypt (Secret Key)  
│  
▼  
Encrypted Data  
│  
│ ------------------------------>  
│  
▼  
Decrypt (Same Secret Key)  
│  
▼  
Plain Data



### Advantages
- Very fast
- Efficient for **large / bulk data**
- Low computational cost

### Problems

#### 1. Key Sharing Problem
- How do sender and receiver **securely share the secret key**?
- If key is intercepted → entire communication is compromised

#### 2. Scalability Problem
- For **N users**, required keys:

N(N−1)/2

- Not practical for large networks (internet)

###  Conclusion
- Excellent for **data encryption**
- Terrible for **initial trust and key exchange**

## 2️⃣ Asymmetric Encryption

### What it is
- Uses a **key pair**
- **Public Key** → Encrypt
- **Private Key** → Decrypt

## 3️⃣ Problem 
# Encryption Problems Overview

| Problem               | Exists In     | Why |
|-----------------------|---------------|-----|
| Key sharing           | Symmetric     | Same secret key must be securely exchanged |
| Slow performance      | Asymmetric    | Uses heavy mathematical operations |
| Sender authentication| Asymmetric    | Public key is public, sender identity not guaranteed |
| Public key trust      | Asymmetric    | Fake or malicious public keys can be presented |
| Data integrity        | Both          | Message can be modified during transmission |

## 4️⃣ Solution 1: Digital Signature

### What problem it solves
- Sender authentication
- Message integrity
- Non-repudiation

### How it works (Step-by-Step)

**Sender**
Message
|
Hash(Message)
|
Encrypt Hash with Sender PRIVATE KEY
|
Digital Signature


**Receiver**
Message + Signature
|
Decrypt Signature using Sender PUBLIC KEY
|
Hash received Message
|
Compare hashes


### Result
- Hashes match →
  - Sender is authenticated
  - Message not modified

### What it does NOT do
- Does NOT encrypt data
- Does NOT prove public key ownership

---

## 5️⃣ Remaining Problem After Digital Signature

> “How do I trust the sender’s **public key**?”

Anyone can claim:
This is my public key, trust me”


This enables **MITM attacks**.

---

## 6️⃣ Solution 2: Digital Certificate

### What is a Digital Certificate?
A **digitally signed document** that binds:

Identity (Domain / Person)
+
Public Key
+
CA Signature


### Who signs it?
- Trusted **Certificate Authority (CA)**

### What problems it solves
- Public key authenticity
- Prevents fake public keys
- Enables internet-scale trust

---

## 7️⃣ Certificate Verification Flow

Website sends Certificate
|
Browser verifies:

CA signature

Expiry date

Domain name
|
If CA trusted → Public Key trusted


Browsers already trust well-known CAs.

8️⃣ Final Real-World Flow (TLS / HTTPS)
COMPLETE COMMUNICATION FLOW
CLIENT (Browser)                        SERVER (Website)
----------------------------------------------------------

1. ClientHello
   - Supported TLS versions
   - Cipher suites
   - Client Random (Rc)
   ---------------------------------->

2. ServerHello
   - Selected cipher
   - Server Random (Rs)
   - Digital Certificate (Public Key)
   <----------------------------------

3. Certificate Verification
   - Browser verifies CA signature
   - Extracts server public key

4. Key Exchange
   - Browser generates Session Key
   - Encrypts using Server Public Key
   ---------------------------------->

5. Secure Channel Established
   - Both now share Session Key

6. Data Transfer
   - Encrypted using SYMMETRIC encryption (AES)

9️⃣ Why Hybrid Encryption Exists
Purpose	Technique
Key exchange	Asymmetric
Authentication	Digital Signature
Public key trust	Digital Certificate
Data encryption	Symmetric
Hybrid Encryption = Best of both worlds

FINAL INTERVIEW SUMMARY
Symmetric encryption is fast but suffers from key sharing.
Asymmetric encryption solves key sharing but is slow and lacks authentication.
Digital signatures authenticate the sender and ensure integrity.
Digital certificates establish trust in public keys.
TLS combines all of them to create secure internet communication.
