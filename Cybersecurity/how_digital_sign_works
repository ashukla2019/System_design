What Is a Digital Signature?
A digital signature is a cryptographic mechanism that verifies:

Authenticity – who sent the message
Integrity – message was not altered
Non-repudiation – sender cannot deny later

Digital signatures rely on public-key cryptography (like RSA or ECDSA).

High-Level Analogy
Imagine you have:

A private stamp only you own → private key

A public stamp verifier everyone can use → public key

You stamp a document → others verify using the public verifier.

How Digital Signatures Work (Step by Step)
1. Hashing the Data
Before signing, the message is hashed.

Message → Hash Function → Message Digest
Example: SHA-256

Why hash?
Hashing is fast
Prevents signing huge data
Ensures integrity

2. Signing with the Private Key
A cryptographic algorithm (RSA/ECDSA) encrypts the hash with the private key.

Signature = Encrypt(Hash(Message), PrivateKey)
Only the owner has the private key → ensures authenticity.

3. Sending the Message + Signature
Sender sends:

original message

the digital signature

4. Verification by the Receiver
Receiver does two things:

A. Hashes the received message
Received Message → SHA-256 → hash1
B. Decrypts the signature using sender’s public key
Decrypt(Signature, PublicKey) → hash2
If hash1 == hash2 → signature is valid
Meaning:

message not changed
sender is verified
sender cannot deny signing

Why the Public Key Works?
Because:

Private key signs
Public key verifies

Public key cannot generate a signature, only check it.
