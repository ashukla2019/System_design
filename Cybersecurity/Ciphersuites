K- key exchange
A- Authentication
S- Symmetric Encryption
h- Hash



🔐 1. Key Exchange (K)
✅ Purpose:
Securely establish a shared secret key between two parties (e.g., client and server), even over an untrusted network.

🛠️ Common Algorithms:
RSA (Legacy)
Diffie-Hellman (DH): Secure but slower.
Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDHE): Faster and provides forward secrecy.

🔄 Example Flow:
Client and server agree on a method (e.g., ECDHE).

They exchange public parameters.

Each side computes the shared key independently.

🔐 The shared key is used for symmetric encryption (see #3).

----------------------------------

👤 2. Authentication (A)
✅ Purpose:
Confirms the identity of the server (and optionally the client).

Prevents man-in-the-middle attacks.

🛠️ Common Algorithms:
RSA: The server proves its identity using a certificate and private key.
ECDSA: Elliptic Curve version; smaller, faster.

📜 How It Works:
Server sends a digital certificate (X.509).
The client verifies the certificate against trusted Certificate Authorities (CAs).

🔏 In mutual TLS, the client also provides a certificate.

------------------------------------
🔒 3. Symmetric Encryption (S)
✅ Purpose:
Encrypt and decrypt the actual data using the shared key.Symmetric encryption is fast and used for all data after the handshake.

🛠️ Common Algorithms:
AES-128-GCM, AES-256-CBC
ChaCha20-Poly1305 (optimized for mobile devices)

🔁 How It Works:
Both client and server now have the same key (from key exchange).

This key encrypts/decrypts all data quickly and securely.

-------------------------------------
🧾 4. Hash / MAC (H)
✅ Purpose:
Ensure data integrity and authentication.
Verifies that the message was not altered in transit.

🛠️ Common Algorithms:
SHA256, SHA384, SHA1 (deprecated)
Poly1305 (used with ChaCha20)

🔎 How It Works:
A MAC (Message Authentication Code) or hash is attached to encrypted data.
The receiver checks it before trusting the data.

✅ Some modes like GCM and Poly1305 combine encryption + integrity (called AEAD — Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data).
