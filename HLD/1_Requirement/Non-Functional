Non-Functional Requirements (Short)
1️⃣ Latency
Response time of the system.
Measured in ms (P50, P95, P99)
Lower latency = better user experience
---------------------------------
2️⃣ Scalability
Ability to handle increased load (users/traffic/data).
Vertical: bigger machine
Horizontal: more machines
---------------------------------
3️⃣ Availability
Uptime of the system.
Measured in % (99.9%, 99.99%)
Achieved via redundancy & failover
---------------------------------
4️⃣ Durability
Guarantee that data is not lost once written.
Achieved using replication, backups
Example: S3 (11 nines durability)
---------------------------------
5️⃣ Consistency
All users see the same data at the same time.
Strong vs Eventual consistency
Trade-off with availability (CAP theorem)

One-line memory trick 🧠
Latency = Speed | Scalability = Growth | Availability = Uptime | Durability = Data Safety | Consistency = Same Data
