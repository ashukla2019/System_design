Non-Functional Requirements
1️⃣ Latency
Definition:
Time taken for a request to receive a response.

Typical Metrics:

Average latency

p95 / p99 latency

Example Requirement:

p99 latency < 300 ms for read operations

Design Choices Affected:

Caching (Redis / CDN)

Read replicas

Async processing

Geographically closer deployments
------------------------------------

2️⃣ Availability
Definition:
Percentage of time the system is operational and accessible.

Common Targets:

99.9% (≈ 8.7 hrs downtime/year)

99.99% (≈ 52 mins downtime/year)

Example Requirement:

System must achieve 99.99% availability

Design Choices Affected:

Multi-AZ / Multi-region setup

Load balancers

Health checks and failover
------------------------------

3️⃣ Scalability
Definition:
Ability of the system to handle increasing load without performance degradation.

Types:

Horizontal scalability (scale out)

Vertical scalability (scale up)

Example Requirement:

System should scale from 10k to 1M users

Design Choices Affected:

Stateless services

Auto-scaling groups

Sharding and partitioning
------------------------------
4️⃣ Durability
Definition:
Guarantee that once data is written, it will not be lost.

Example Requirement:

Data durability ≥ 99.999999999% (11 nines)

Design Choices Affected:

Replication across AZs

Write-ahead logging

Backups and snapshots

📌 Durability ≠ Availability
Data can be durable even if the system is temporarily unavailable.
---------------------------

5️⃣ Consistency
Definition:
Degree to which all users see the same data at the same time.

Types:

Strong consistency

Eventual consistency

Causal consistency

Example Requirement:

Balance updates must be strongly consistent

Design Choices Affected:

CAP theorem trade-offs

Distributed locking

Consensus protocols (Raft / Paxos)
