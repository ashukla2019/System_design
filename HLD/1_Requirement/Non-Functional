Non-Functional Requirements:
S-> Scalability
C-> Consistency
A-> Availability
L-> Latency
D-> Durability

1) Scalability
Ability to handle increased load (users/traffic/data).
Vertical: bigger machine
Horizontal: more machines

2) Consistency
All users see the same data at the same time.
Strong vs Eventual consistency
Trade-off with availability (CAP theorem)

3) Availability
Uptime of the system.
Measured in % (99.9%, 99.99%)
Achieved via redundancy & failover

4) Latency
Response time of the system.
Measured in ms (P50, P95, P99)
Lower latency = better user experience

5) Durability
Guarantee that data is not lost once written.
Achieved using replication, backups
Example: S3 (11 nines durability)

One-line memory trick
Latency = Speed | Scalability = Growth | Availability = Uptime | Durability = Data Safety | Consistency = Same Data
