1. Authentication (AuthN) — Who You Are
Purpose: Verify the identity of a user or system

Examples:
Username/password
Multi-factor authentication (MFA)
OAuth/OpenID Connect tokens
Key Point: Confirms identity, but does not determine permissions.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Authorization (AuthZ) — What You Can Access
Purpose: Determine permissions for a user/system after authentication
Examples:
Role-based access control (RBAC)
Attribute-based access control (ABAC)
ACLs (Access Control Lists)
Key Point: AuthZ happens after AuthN.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. SSL/TLS — Encrypt Data in Transit
SSL/TLS encrypts communication between clients and servers
Ensures:
Confidentiality – data cannot be read by attackers
Integrity – data not tampered
Authentication – server identity verified via certificate
Example: HTTPS websites, secure API calls
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. mTLS (Mutual TLS) — Service-to-Service Trust
Mutual TLS extends TLS by authenticating both client and server
Used in microservices or service-to-service communication
Ensures:
Only trusted services can communicate
Encrypted communication
Example: Service A calls Service B securely, both verify each other’s certificate

5. SSDLC — Security in All Phases
Secure Software Development Life Cycle
Integrates security practices throughout development, not just at the end

Phases:
Requirements & Design → threat modeling
Implementation → secure coding, code reviews
Testing → static/dynamic analysis, penetration testing
Deployment → hardened configurations
Maintenance → patching, monitoring
Goal: Build security by design, not as an afterthought
