Redis (Remote Dictionary Server) is a high-performance, in-memory data store used mainly for caching, fast data access, 
and real-time systems.
It’s extremely fast because it keeps data in RAM.

What Redis Is Used For:
Caching database queries
Session storage
Real-time counters & leaderboards
Pub/Sub messaging
Rate limiting
Distributed locks
Queues (lightweight)

Key Characteristics
In-memory (microsecond latency)
Key–value store
Supports rich data structures
Single-threaded (very fast event loop)
Optional persistence to disk
Redis Data Structures

Common Redis Patterns
1. Caching
App → Redis → Database
Check Redis first
Fall back to DB if cache miss

2. Session Store
Store user sessions
Stateless application servers

3. Rate Limiting
Count requests per user/IP
Enforce limits efficiently

4. Pub/Sub
Real-time notifications
Lightweight event broadcasting

5. Distributed Locking
Prevent concurrent access
Example: job processing
Redis Persistence
Redis can persist data using:
RDB – snapshots
AOF – append-only log
