Supported SQL Operations:
1. Data Definition Language (DDL): Used to define and modify database structures:
	CREATE	Create databases, tables, indexes, views:
		CREATE DATABASE company_db;
		CREATE TABLE employees (
		employee_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
		first_name VARCHAR(50),
		last_name VARCHAR(50),
		email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE,
		hire_date DATE NOT NULL,
		department_id INT
		);
		CREATE INDEX idx_employees_lastname
		ON employees(last_name);
	
	ALTER	Modify existing database objects
		Add a column
		ALTER TABLE employees ADD salary INT;
		 Drop a column
		ALTER TABLE employees DROP COLUMN salary;
		 Modify datatype
		ALTER TABLE employees MODIFY name VARCHAR(200);
		 Add a constraint
		ALTER TABLE employees ADD CONSTRAINT emp_email_unique UNIQUE(email);
	
	DROP	Completely deletes a table or database from the system.
		Example:
		 Drop a table
		DROP TABLE employees;
		 Drop a database
		DROP DATABASE company_db;
		After DROP — the table is gone forever.
	
	TRUNCATE	Deletes all rows from a table but keeps the table structure.
	

----------------------------------------

2. Data Manipulation Language (DML): Used to manipulate data within tables:
	Command	Description
	SELECT	Retrieve data
		SELECT employee_id, first_name, last_name, email
		FROM employees;
	INSERT	Add new records
		INSERT INTO employees (first_name, last_name, email, hire_date, department_id)
		VALUES ('John', 'Doe', 'john.doe@example.com', '2025-01-10', 2);
	UPDATE	Modify existing records
		UPDATE employees
		SET email = 'john.newemail@example.com'
		WHERE employee_id = 1;
	DELETE	Remove records
		DELETE FROM employees
		WHERE employee_id = 1;
---------------------------------------------
3. Data Control Language (DCL)
	Used to control access to data:

	Command	Description
	GRANT	Provide user access privileges
	REVOKE	Remove user access privileges

1) GRANT SELECT, INSERT
ON users
TO app_user;
Meaning:
app_user can read and insert data into users table.

2) REVOKE
Definition: Removes previously granted privileges.

REVOKE INSERT
ON users
FROM app_user;
Meaning:
app_user can no longer insert data.
---------------------------------------------------
4. Transaction Control Language (TCL): Used to manage transactions:

	Command	Description
	BEGIN / START TRANSACTION	Begin a transaction
	COMMIT	Save changes made during the transaction
	ROLLBACK	Undo changes since the last commit
	SAVEPOINT	Set a point within a transaction to roll back to
----------------------------------------------------------------
5. Joins and Queries: SQL supports powerful querying through:

	1. INNER JOIN: Returns only matching rows from both tables.
	SELECT e.first_name, e.last_name, d.department_name
	FROM employees e
	INNER JOIN departments d
		ON e.department_id = d.department_id;
		
	2. LEFT JOIN / RIGHT JOIN
	LEFT JOIN: Returns all employees + matching departments (NULL if no match).

	SELECT e.first_name, e.last_name, d.department_name
	FROM employees e
	LEFT JOIN departments d
		ON e.department_id = d.department_id;

	RIGHT JOIN: Returns all departments + matching employees.

	SELECT d.department_name, e.first_name, e.last_name
	FROM departments d
	RIGHT JOIN employees e
		ON d.department_id = e.department_id;
		
	3. FULL OUTER JOIN: Returns all rows from both tables, matched where possible.
	MySQL does not support FULL OUTER JOIN directly,
	but PostgreSQL, SQL Server, and Oracle do.

	SELECT e.first_name, d.department_name
	FROM employees e
	FULL OUTER JOIN departments d
		ON e.department_id = d.department_id;
		
	4. SELF JOIN: Used when a table references itself (e.g., managers).
	Assume: employees.manager_id references another employee.

	SELECT e.first_name AS employee,
		   m.first_name AS manager
	FROM employees e
	LEFT JOIN employees m
		ON e.manager_id = m.employee_id;
		
	5. UNION / INTERSECT / EXCEPT: Rows must have the same number of columns & compatible types.

	UNION:Combines rows and removes duplicates.

	SELECT first_name FROM employees
	UNION
	SELECT department_name FROM departments;

	UNION ALL: Keeps duplicates.
	SELECT first_name FROM employees
	UNION ALL
	SELECT department_name FROM departments;

	INTERSECT: Keeps only rows in both results (not supported in MySQL, but supported in PostgreSQL, 
	SQL Server, Oracle).

	SELECT department_id FROM employees
	INTERSECT
	SELECT department_id FROM departments;

	EXCEPT (also called MINUS)

	Rows in the first query not in the second.

	SELECT department_id FROM employees
	EXCEPT
	SELECT department_id FROM departments;

	6. GROUP BY, HAVING, ORDER BY
	GROUP BY
	SELECT department_id, COUNT(*) AS num_employees
	FROM employees
	GROUP BY department_id;

	HAVING (filters groups, not rows)
	SELECT department_id, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary
	FROM employees
	GROUP BY department_id
	HAVING AVG(salary) > 50000;

	ORDER BY
	SELECT first_name, salary
	FROM employees
	ORDER BY salary DESC;
