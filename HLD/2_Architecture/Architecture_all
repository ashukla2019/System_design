Need solid info about architectures, not pros and cons but def, usecase etc for momolithic, microservice, even based, serverless, statefull and stateless

Below is solid, concise, exam / interview-ready architecture knowledge — only definition + how it works + when to use + example.
No pros/cons, no fluff. Easy to remember.

1️⃣ Monolithic Architecture
Definition
A single application where UI, business logic, and data access are tightly coupled and deployed as one unit.

How it works
One codebase → one build → one deployment → one runtime.

Use case

Small to medium applications

Early-stage products

Simple business logic

Example
E-commerce app where user login, product catalog, orders, and payments run in one application.

2️⃣ Microservices Architecture
Definition
Application is split into independent services, each responsible for one business capability, communicating over the network.

How it works
Each service has:

Its own code

Its own database

Independent deployment

Use case

Large-scale systems

Rapid feature development

Teams working independently

Example
E-commerce system with separate services for:

User Service

Order Service

Payment Service

Inventory Service

3️⃣ Event-Driven Architecture (EDA)
Definition
System components communicate by producing and consuming events instead of direct calls.

How it works

Producer emits an event

Event broker (Kafka, SNS, EventHub)

Consumers react asynchronously

Use case

Highly decoupled systems

Real-time processing

Audit & tracking systems

Example
OrderPlaced event →
Inventory Service updates stock →
Notification Service sends email →
Analytics Service logs data

4️⃣ Serverless Architecture
Definition
Application runs using cloud-managed execution, without managing servers; logic executes as functions.

How it works

Trigger (HTTP, event, schedule)

Function executes

Cloud handles scaling and infra

Use case

Spiky traffic

Short-lived tasks

APIs and background jobs

Example
AWS Lambda handling:

API requests

File uploads

Cron jobs

5️⃣ Stateful Architecture
Definition
Application stores client state (session data) on the server.

How it works
Same user must hit the same server to continue the session.

Use case

Legacy applications

Session-heavy workflows

Example
Web server storing user session in server memory.

6️⃣ Stateless Architecture
Definition
Application does not store client state; each request is independent.

How it works
State is stored externally (DB, cache, token).

Use case

Cloud-native apps

Load-balanced systems

Microservices

Example
REST API using JWT token for authentication.

Architecture	     Key Idea
Monolithic	       One app, one deployment
Microservices	    Small independent services
Event-Driven	     Communicate via events
Serverless	       Run code without servers
Stateful.         Server remembers client
Stateless	         Server forgets client
