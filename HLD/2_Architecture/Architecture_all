Below is a clear, system-design–oriented explanation of each architecture style you mentioned, with definitions, internal behavior, pros/cons, and real-world usage. This is written to build complete conceptual clarity, not just exam definitions.

1️⃣ Monolithic Architecture
What it is
All application components are built, deployed, and scaled as a single unit.

[ UI ]
[ Business Logic ]
[ Data Access ]
[ Database ]
        ↓
   Single Deployable App
Characteristics
Single codebase

Single deployment

Tight coupling between modules

One failure can affect the whole system

Pros
✔ Simple to develop initially
✔ Easy debugging
✔ Easy local testing
✔ Lower operational complexity

Cons
❌ Hard to scale specific parts
❌ Slow deployments
❌ Risky changes
❌ Technology lock-in

When to use
Small applications

MVPs

Early-stage startups

Teams with limited DevOps maturity

Example
Traditional Java Spring MVC app

PHP + Apache application
-----------------------------------
2️⃣ Microservices Architecture
What it is
Application is split into small, independent services, each handling a single business capability.

[ User Service ] → DB
[ Order Service ] → DB
[ Payment Service ] → DB
[ Notification Service ]
Characteristics
Independently deployable

Each service has its own database

Communicate via HTTP/gRPC/events

Decentralized governance

Pros
✔ Independent scaling
✔ Fault isolation
✔ Faster deployments
✔ Technology flexibility

Cons
❌ Complex networking
❌ Distributed data consistency
❌ Higher DevOps cost
❌ Debugging is harder

When to use
Large systems

High-traffic applications

Multiple teams

Rapid feature evolution

Example
Netflix

Amazon backend

Kubernetes-based systems
-----------------------------------
3️⃣ Event-Driven Architecture (EDA)
What it is
Components communicate via events, not direct calls.

Producer → Event Bus → Consumer(s)
Example:

OrderPlaced Event
   ├── Payment Service
   ├── Inventory Service
   └── Email Service
Key Components
Event producers

Event consumers

Message broker (Kafka, SNS/SQS, RabbitMQ)

Pros
✔ Loose coupling
✔ High scalability
✔ Asynchronous processing
✔ Natural fit for real-time systems

Cons
❌ Hard to trace flow
❌ Event ordering challenges
❌ Event schema versioning issues

When to use
Real-time systems

Analytics pipelines

Microservices communication

High throughput systems

Example
Kafka-based systems

AWS SNS + SQS

Stock trading systems

-----------------------------------
 4. Serverless Architecture
What it is
You write functions, cloud provider handles:

Servers

Scaling

Availability

API Gateway → Lambda → DynamoDB
Characteristics
Event-triggered execution

No server management

Pay per execution

Stateless by default

Pros
✔ Zero server management
✔ Auto-scaling
✔ Cost-efficient for spiky traffic

Cons
❌ Cold start latency
❌ Vendor lock-in
❌ Execution time limits

When to use
Event-driven workloads

APIs

Background jobs

Infrequent tasks

Example
AWS Lambda

Azure Functions

Google Cloud Functions
-----------------------------------
5️⃣ Stateful Architecture
What it is
Application stores client state in memory or local storage.

Client → Same Server → Session Data
Characteristics
Session data stored on server

Client tied to a specific server

Hard to scale horizontally

Pros
✔ Faster access to session data
✔ Simple implementation

Cons
❌ Poor scalability
❌ Sticky sessions needed
❌ Failures lose state

When to use
Legacy systems

Small internal apps

Example
Traditional web apps using HTTP sessions
-----------------------------------
6️⃣ Stateless Architecture
What it is
Server does NOT store client state between requests.

Client → Any Server → DB / Cache
Characteristics
Each request is independent

State stored in DB, cache, or token

Easy horizontal scaling

Pros
✔ Highly scalable
✔ Fault tolerant
✔ Cloud-native friendly

Cons
❌ External state management needed
❌ Slight latency overhead

When to use
Cloud applications

REST APIs

Microservices

Example
JWT-based authentication

RESTful APIs
