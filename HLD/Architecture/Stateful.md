"Stateful"
describes a system, application, or protocol that remembers and uses information from past interactions (its "state")
to influence future responses, creating a continuous, contextual experience, unlike systems that treat each request as 
brand new. Think of it as a conversation where the other person remembers what you said earlier; examples include 
online banking, gaming, or streaming services where your session progress is saved.

Key Characteristics:
    Memory: Stores data like user preferences, session progress, or cart contents.
    Context: Each new request builds on previous ones, allowing for personalized and seamless interactions.
    Server Affinity (Often): May need to direct users to the same server to access their specific session data. 

Real-World Examples:
    Online Banking: Remembers your logged-in status and transaction history.
    E-commerce Carts: Items stay in your cart across sessions.
    : Tracks data transfers within a session.
    : Maintains an active connection with context
