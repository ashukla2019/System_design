A Reverse Proxy is a server that sits in front of backend servers and receives client requests on their behalf, 
mainly to protect, manage, and optimize servers.

Client → Reverse Proxy → Backend Servers

How a Reverse Proxy Protects Servers
1. Hides Backend Servers
Clients never see real server IPs
Reduces attack surface
Prevents direct access

2. Load Balancing
Distributes traffic across multiple servers
Prevents overload and downtime

3. DDoS Protection
Absorbs and filters malicious traffic
Rate limiting and traffic shaping

4. SSL/TLS Termination
Handles HTTPS encryption/decryption
Reduces CPU load on backend servers

5. Web Application Firewall (WAF)
Blocks common attacks:
SQL injection
XSS
Path traversal

6. Caching
Serves cached content
Reduces backend requests
Improves performance
