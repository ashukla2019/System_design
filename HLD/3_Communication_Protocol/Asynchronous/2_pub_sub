What Pub/Sub Means
Publisher → emits an event
Broker / Topic → distributes the event
Subscribers → receive copies of the event

----------------------------------------------------------------
Core Components
1. Publisher
Produces events (facts that something happened)
Example: OrderCreated, UserSignedUp

2. Topic (or Channel)
Logical stream of events
Events are sent to a topic, not directly to consumers

3. Subscribers
Services or apps interested in those events
Each subscriber gets its own copy
Event Distribution Flow
Event occurs
Publisher publishes to a topic
Broker fans out the event
Subscribers consume independently
