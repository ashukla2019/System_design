1️⃣ HTTP
Definition
HTTP is a stateless request–response protocol used for communication between client and server.

How it works
Client sends request → Server processes → Server sends response → Connection ends (usually).

Key idea
One request → one response
Use cases
Web pagesAPIs

File downloads
Standard client-server communication

Example
Browser requesting a webpage or calling /login.
----------------------
2️⃣ REST (Representational State Transfer)
Definition
REST is an architectural style built on top of HTTP for designing APIs using standard HTTP methods.

How it works

Resources identified by URLs

Uses HTTP verbs:
GET → read
POST → create
PUT/PATCH → update
DELETE → remove

Stateless communication

Key idea
Structured way to design HTTP APIs

Use cases
Backend APIs
Microservices communication
CRUD-based systems

Example
GET /users/1
POST /orders

Important interview line:

“REST is not a protocol; it’s a design style that uses HTTP.”
-------------------------
3️⃣ WebSockets
Definition
WebSocket is a full-duplex, persistent communication protocol over a single TCP connection.

How it works

Initial HTTP handshake
Connection upgrades to WebSocket
Client and server can send messages anytime

Key idea
Real-time, two-way communication

Use cases
Chat applications
Live notifications
Online gaming
Stock price updates

Example
WhatsApp chat, live score updates.

🔁 Core Differences (Very Important)
Aspect	HTTP	REST	WebSockets
Type	Protocol	Architectural style	Protocol
Connection	Short-lived	Short-lived	Persistent
Communication	Request–response	Request–response	Bi-directional
Real-time	❌	❌	✅
Stateless	Yes	Yes	Can be stateful
🧠 Memory Hooks (Easy Recall)
HTTP → How messages are sent
REST → How APIs are designed
WebSocket → Real-time two-way talk
