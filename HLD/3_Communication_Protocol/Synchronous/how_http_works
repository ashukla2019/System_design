How HTTP Works:
HTTP = HyperText Transfer Protocol
It’s a request–response protocol between client (browser) and server.

Step-by-step HTTP flow:
1)User enters URL
http://example.com

2)DNS Resolution
Browser asks DNS: “What is the IP of example.com?”
DNS returns → 93.184.216.34

3)TCP Connection:
Browser opens a TCP connection to server
Default HTTP port → 80

4)HTTP Request
GET /index.html HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
User-Agent: Chrome

5) Server Processing
Server reads request
Fetches data (file, DB, API, etc.)

6) HTTP Response
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/html

<html>...</html>
7) Connection Close or Reuse
Closed (HTTP/1.0)
Reused (HTTP/1.1 keep-alive)

Problems with HTTP
Data is plain text

Anyone can:
Read data (sniffing)
Modify data (MITM attack)
Impersonate server
------------------------
How HTTPS Works (HTTP + Security)
HTTPS = HTTP over TLS/SSL

It adds:
Encryption(solves read data/sniffing)
Data Integrity(modify data)
Authentication(solves impersonating server/spoofing)
Default port → 443
----------------☆
HTTPS Step-by-Step (Very Important)
🔹 Step 1: DNS Resolution
Same as HTTP → get server IP

🔹 Step 2: TCP Connection
Client connects to server on port 443

🔹 Step 3: TLS Handshake (Heart of HTTPS)
This happens before HTTP data is exchanged.

a) Client Hello
Client sends:
TLS version
Cipher suites
Random number

b) Server Hello
Server responds with:
Chosen cipher suite
SSL certificate
Server random number

Step 4: Certificate Verification
Browser checks:
Certificate signed by Trusted CA
Domain name matches
Certificate not expired
If invalid → browser shows Not Secure

🔹 Step 5: Key Exchange
Client generates Session Key
Encrypts it using server’s public key
Server decrypts using private key
Now both share same session key

🔹 Step 6: Encrypted HTTP Communication
Now normal HTTP happens, but:

Data is encrypted
No one can read or modify it
GET /login HTTP/1.1   (encrypted)
