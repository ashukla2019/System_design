# 🧠 Mental Model of Azure

Most internet systems follow this **simple architecture**:


Internet
↓
DNS
↓
Load Balancer
↓
Application Servers
↓
Database / Storage


> Most Azure services exist to **support this flow**.

# 🌍 PART 1 — AZURE GLOBAL INFRASTRUCTURE


Azure Global Network
│
▼
Regions
│
▼
Availability Zones
│
▼
Data Centers
│
▼
Physical Servers


<details>
<summary>Why Azure designed it this way</summary>

Traditional hosting problems:

❌ single datacenter failure  
❌ natural disasters  
❌ limited scalability  

Azure solution:

✔ multiple regions  
✔ multiple AZs  
✔ isolated infrastructure
</details>

**Memory Trick**:


Region > AZ > Datacenter > Server


---

# 🏢 PART 2 — DATACENTER ARCHITECTURE

Inside Azure datacenters:


Rack
├── Physical Server
│
├── CPU
├── RAM
├── SSD / NVMe
└── Network Card


Thousands of racks exist per facility.

<details>
<summary>Why needed</summary>

Supports large-scale applications like:

* Microsoft 365  
* LinkedIn  
* Xbox Live
</details>

---

# ⚙️ PART 3 — HYPERVISOR

Azure uses **Hyper-V** for virtualization.


Physical Server
│
▼
Hypervisor (Hyper-V)
│
▼
Multiple Virtual Machines


**Memory Trick**:


Server = Building
VMs = Apartments
Hypervisor = Building manager


---

# 🌐 PART 4 — VIRTUAL NETWORK (VNet)

Private Azure network.


Azure Region
│
▼
VNet
│
├── Public Subnet
└── Private Subnet


<details>
<summary>Why VNet exists</summary>

* Provides private network isolation  
* Controls IP addressing  
* Enables routing & firewall rules
</details>

---

# 🔀 PART 5 — SUBNETS


VNet
│
├── Public Subnet
│ ├── Load Balancer
│ └── Web Servers
│
└── Private Subnet
├── App Servers
└── Database


**Memory Trick**:


Public Subnet → Internet-facing
Private Subnet → Internal servers


---

# 🌍 PART 6 — INTERNET GATEWAY / PUBLIC IP


Internet
│
▼
Public IP / Internet Gateway
│
▼
Route Table
│
▼
Public Subnet


> Acts as **front door** of your VNet.

---

# 🔁 PART 7 — NAT GATEWAY


Private VM
│
▼
NAT Gateway
│
▼
Internet


✔ outbound allowed  
❌ inbound blocked

<details>
<summary>Why NAT exists</summary>

Private VMs often need to:

* download updates  
* access APIs  
* fetch packages  
But must **not expose themselves publicly**
</details>

---

# 🔐 PART 8 — SECURITY LAYERS

| Layer          | Scope    |
| -------------- | -------- |
| Network Security Group (NSG) | VM / Subnet |
| Azure Firewall / Route Table   | VNet / Subnet |

### NSG


VM
│
▼
Network Security Group


- Stateful firewall  
- Controls traffic per VM or subnet

### Azure Firewall


VNet / Subnet
│
▼
Azure Firewall


- Central firewall for VNet traffic  
- Stateless filtering  

---

# 🖥 PART 9 — VIRTUAL MACHINES (VMs)

Typical request flow:


User
│
▼
DNS
│
▼
Load Balancer
│
▼
VMs
│
▼
Application


---

# ⚖️ PART 10 — LOAD BALANCER


User
│
▼
Azure Load Balancer
│
├─ VM #1
├─ VM #2
└─ VM #3


<details>
<summary>Why needed</summary>

Without it:

* One server gets all traffic → crash  

Load balancers **distribute traffic evenly**.
</details>

---

# 📈 PART 11 — SCALE SETS

Automatically scale VMs:


High CPU / Traffic
↓
Scale Set deploys new VM


---

# 💾 PART 12 — STORAGE ACCOUNTS

| Storage | Type           |
| ------- | -------------- |
| Managed Disks | Block storage  |
| Azure Files  | File storage   |
| Blob Storage | Object storage |

---

# 🪣 BLOB STORAGE


Container
└── Blobs


Used for:

* images, videos, backups, logs

<details>
<summary>Why Blob Storage</summary>

Traditional file storage cannot scale to **billions of files**  
Blob Storage solves this problem.
</details>

---

# 🔑 PART 13 — AZURE AD (IDENTITY & ACCESS)


User
│
▼
Azure AD
│
▼
Azure Services


Principle: **Least Privilege**

---

# 📊 PART 14 — AZURE MONITOR


VM Metrics
│
▼
Azure Monitor
│
▼
Alerts / Dashboards


Tracks CPU, memory, logs.

---

# 🖥 PART 15 — AUTOMATION & MANAGEMENT


VM
│
▼
Azure Automation / Runbooks
│
▼
Management Tasks


- No SSH required  
- Centralized patching & updates  

---

# 🔗 PART 16 — SERVICE COMMUNICATION

VM accessing storage:


VM
│
▼
Managed Identity
│
▼
Blob Storage


---

# 🔒 PART 17 — PRIVATE ENDPOINTS


VM
│
▼
Private Endpoint
│
▼
Azure Service


- Provides **private access**  
- No internet exposure

---

# 🏗 PART 18 — PRODUCTION ARCHITECTURE


User
│
▼
DNS
│
▼
CDN / Front Door
│
▼
Load Balancer
│
▼
Scale Set VMs
│
▼
Database

# 🔄 PART 19 — DATA FLOW


User
↓
DNS
↓
Load Balancer

# ⚙️ PART 20 — CONTROL PLANE VS DATA PLANE


User / API
│
▼
CONTROL PLANE
(Resource management)
│
▼
DATA PLANE
(Application traffic)


### Control Plane

Manages infrastructure:


Create VM
Create VNet
Create Storage Account
Assign RBAC Policy


### Data Plane

Handles **real application traffic**:


Upload file to Blob Storage
Download file
Send HTTP request to VM
Query SQL Database


### Analogy


Restaurant Owner → Control Plane
Customers Eating → Data Plane

# 🧠 Final Memory Story


User visits website
→ DNS finds server
→ Load Balancer distributes traffic
→ VM runs application
→ Database stores data
