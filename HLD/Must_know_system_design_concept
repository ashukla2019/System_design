1. Load Balancing
What
Distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers.

Why
Prevents one server from getting overloaded
Improves availability & reliability

How
Round Robin
Least Connections
IP Hash

Where
Nginx, HAProxy, AWS ALB/ELB

Example
User → Load Balancer → App Server 1 / 2 / 3
----------------------------
2. Caching
What
Stores frequently accessed data in fast storage (RAM).

Why

Reduces latency

Reduces DB load

Types

Client-side (browser)

Server-side (Redis, Memcached)

DB cache

CDN cache

Example
Request → Cache hit → return fast
Request → Cache miss → DB → store in cache
----------------------------
3. CDN (Content Delivery Network)
What
A global network of servers that deliver static content closer to users.

Why

Faster load times

Less load on origin servers

Used for

Images

Videos

JS/CSS

Static HTML

Examples

Cloudflare

AWS CloudFront

Akamai
----------------------------
4. Message Queue
What
A buffer that stores messages between producers and consumers.

Why

Decouples services

Handles traffic spikes

Improves reliability

Popular tools

RabbitMQ

Kafka

AWS SQS

Example
Order Service → Queue → Email Service

----------------------------
5. Publish–Subscribe (Pub-Sub)
What
Producers publish events, subscribers receive them.

Why

One event → many consumers

Loose coupling

Difference from Queue

Queue: one consumer per message

Pub-Sub: many consumers per message

Example
UserRegistered Event → Email Service + Analytics + Notification

----------------------------
6. API Gateway
What
Single entry point for all client requests.

Why

Authentication

Rate limiting

Logging

Routing

API versioning

Examples

AWS API Gateway

Kong

Apigee

Flow
Client → API Gateway → Microservices

----------------------------
7. Circuit Breaker
What
Stops calling a failing service temporarily.

Why

Prevents cascading failures

Improves system stability

States

Closed → normal

Open → block calls

Half-open → test recovery

Tools

Resilience4j

Hystrix

----------------------------
8. Service Discovery
What
Automatically finds service instances.

Why

IPs change in microservices

Dynamic scaling

Types
Client-side (Eureka)
Server-side (Kubernetes DNS)

Example
Service A → Service Registry → Service B

----------------------------
9. Sharding
What
Splitting a database into smaller parts (shards).

Why
Scale horizontally
Improve performance
Shard Keys
User ID
Region
Hash

Example
Users 1–1M → DB1
Users 1M–2M → DB2

----------------------------
10. Rate Limiting
What
Limits number of requests per user/IP.

Why
Prevent abuse
Protect backend
Fair usage

Algorithms
Token bucket
Leaky bucket
Fixed window

Where
API Gateway
Load balancer

----------------------------
11. Consistent Hashing
What
Hashing technique that minimizes re-mapping when nodes change.

Why
Useful for caches & sharding
Avoids massive data reshuffle

Used in
Distributed cache
Load balancing

Key Benefit
Adding/removing a server affects only nearby keys.

----------------------------
12. Auto Scaling
What
Automatically increases or decreases servers based on load.

Why
Handle traffic spikes
Reduce cost
Triggers
CPU usage
Memory
Request count

Examples
AWS Auto Scaling Group
Kubernetes HPA
