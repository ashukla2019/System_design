High-level design or HLD is an initial step in the development of applications where the overall structure of a system is planned.

Focuses mainly on how different components of the system work together without getting to know about internal coding and implementation.
Helps everyone involved in the project to understand the goals and ensures good communication during development.
Crucial for developers, architects, and product managers because it allows them to make sure that all stakeholders are aligned with the project objectives. That's why it is also known as macro-level design.
