1. Normalization — Reduce Redundancy
Normalization is the process of organizing data to eliminate duplication and improve data integrity.

Goals
Avoid duplicate data
Prevent update anomalies
Ensure consistency

How It Works
Split data into related tables
Use primary keys and foreign keys

Example
Instead of:
Orders(order_id, customer_name, customer_email)

Normalization:
Customers(customer_id, name, email)
Orders(order_id, customer_id)

Pros
✅ Less storage
✅ Data consistency
✅ Easier updates

Cons
❌ More joins
❌ Slower reads in complex queries

2. Denormalization — Faster Reads
Denormalization intentionally adds redundancy to improve read performance.

Goals
Reduce joins
Speed up queries
Optimize for read-heavy workloads

How It Works
Duplicate frequently accessed data
Store precomputed or aggregated values

Example
Orders(order_id, customer_name, customer_email)

Pros
✅ Faster read queries
✅ Simpler queries

Cons
❌ Data duplication
❌ Risk of inconsistency
❌ More complex writes
