A distributed database stores data across multiple nodes or servers instead of a single machine.
Goal: High availability, scalability, and fault tolerance.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
2. Replication — Availability
Replication means copying data across multiple nodes.

Purpose
If one node fails → data is still available
Improves read performance (can read from replicas)

Types
Master-Slave: writes go to master, reads can go to slaves
Master-Master: multiple nodes can handle writes (conflict resolution needed)

Pros
✅ High availability
✅ Fault tolerance
✅ Read scaling

Cons
❌ Potential consistency issues
❌ More storage required

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

Sharding — Scalability
Sharding means splitting data across multiple nodes.

Purpose
Handles large datasets that don’t fit on one server
Each node stores only a subset of data (shard)

Example
User IDs 1–1000 → Shard 1
User IDs 1001–2000 → Shard 2

Pros
✅ Horizontal scalability
✅ Faster writes & reads per shard

Cons
❌ Complex queries across shards
❌ Rebalancing shards is hard

CAP Theorem — Choose 2 of 3
In a distributed system, you can only fully achieve 2 out of 3:

C	A	P
Consistency: All nodes see the same data at the same time	Availability: System always responds	Partition Tolerance: 
System works even if nodes can’t communicate
Implications

CA (Consistency + Availability) → Fails if network partition occurs
CP (Consistency + Partition Tolerance) → May reject requests during partition
AP (Availability + Partition Tolerance) → Data may be inconsistent temporarily
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How Replication & Sharding Fit
Replication → improves availability, can affect consistency
Sharding → improves scalability, may affect query complexity

Both must consider CAP trade-offs

Real-World Examples
Cassandra → AP (eventual consistency, highly available)
MongoDB → CP (configurable)
MySQL Replication → CA (single master, replicas)
Redis Cluster → CP or AP depending on config

Summary
Replication → high availability, fault tolerance
Sharding → horizontal scalability
CAP Theorem → can only fully achieve 2/3 (Consistency, Availability, Partition Tolerance)
Consistency → choose strong (accurate) or eventual (fast, available)
