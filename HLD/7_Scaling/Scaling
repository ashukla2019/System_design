Scaling Strategies
Horizontal Scaling (Scale Out)
Add more nodes/machines to a system
Distributes load across multiple servers
Often used in web servers, microservices, databases

Pros:
✅ Can scale almost indefinitely
✅ Improves fault tolerance (redundancy)

Cons:
❌ More complex infrastructure (load balancing, data consistency)

Example:
Adding more web servers behind a load balancer

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Vertical Scaling (Scale Up)
Upgrade a single machine with more resources (CPU, RAM, disk)
Easier to implement initially

Pros:
✅ Simple to implement
✅ No need to modify application for multiple nodes

Cons:
❌ Limited by hardware capacity
❌ Single point of failure

Example:
Upgrading a database server from 16GB RAM → 64GB RAM
