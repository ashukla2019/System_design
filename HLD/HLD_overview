---------------------------------
1. Architecture (Networking-aware)
What you define

Monolithic
Microservices
Event-driven
Client–Server / Peer-to-Peer
Centralized vs Distributed

Networking here
How components talk:

Client → API Gateway → Services
Service → Service (east–west traffic)

Network boundaries:
VPC / Subnets
Public vs Private services

-------------------------
2. Networking & Communication (Core Networking Section)
This is where networking explicitly lives.

Communication model:
Synchronous (HTTP/gRPC)
Asynchronous (Kafka, SQS, RabbitMQ)

Protocols:
HTTP/HTTPS
gRPC
WebSocket
TCP/UDP

Network components:
Load Balancer
API Gateway
DNS
Service Mesh (Istio/Linkerd)

----------------------------
3. Data Management (Network-aware)
What you define

Read/write paths
Data flow
Caching layers

Networking angle
Client → Cache → DB path
Cross-region replication traffic
Data consistency over network latency

Example:
Client → Load Balancer → App → Redis → DB
Networking affects latency, throughput, consistency.
-----------------------
4. Storage (Access over Network)
What you define

SQL / NoSQL
Object / Block / File storage

Networking angle
Local vs Remote storage
Storage access protocol:

NFS
iSCSI
S3 API

-----------------------
5. Scalability (Heavily Network-driven)
What you define

Horizontal vs Vertical scaling
Auto-scaling rules
Networking angle
Load balancing strategies:
Round-robin
Least connections
Service discovery
Traffic routing

Example:

Users → Load Balancer → N App Instances
------------------------
6. Fault Tolerance (Network Failures Included)

Failover
Replication
Retries

Networking angle
Network partitions
Timeouts
Circuit breakers
Multi-AZ / Multi-region routing

Example:

--------------------
7. Security (Network-level Security)
What you define

Authentication & Authorization
Data protection
Networking angle
TLS / HTTPS
Firewall rules
Security groups / NACLs
mTLS between services
VPN / Private endpoints
