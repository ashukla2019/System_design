1. Docker
What it is: Docker is a platform that allows you to create, deploy, and run applications in containers.

Container: A lightweight, standalone package of software that includes everything needed to run it — code, runtime, libraries, and settings.

Images: A Docker image is a template used to create containers. It’s a snapshot of a filesystem and parameters needed to run an app.

2. Kubernetes (K8s)
What it is: Kubernetes is an open-source platform designed to orchestrate (manage, scale, and automate) containerized applications across a cluster of machines.

It helps manage many Docker containers, balancing them across servers, handling scaling, self-healing (restarting failed containers), etc.

3. Pods
What it is: A Pod is the smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes. It can contain one or more containers (usually Docker containers) that share the same network and storage.

Containers in a pod share:
IP address
Port space
Storage volumes

4. Services
What it is: A Service in Kubernetes is a way to expose your pods to other parts of your application or the internet.

It provides a stable IP and DNS name for a set of pods and load-balances traffic to them.Even if pods die and are recreated, the service stays the same, ensuring continuous availability.

5. How They Work Together
Here’s a simplified flow:

You build a Docker image of your app.
You push the image to a container registry (like Docker Hub or a private registry).

In Kubernetes, you define a Pod spec that tells K8s to pull that image and run it in a container.You deploy the pod to the cluster. Kubernetes handles placing the pod on a node (a machine in the cluster).

You define a Service to expose the pod to the outside world or internally to other pods.

Kubernetes ensures that your pod stays running, can be scaled up or down, and is reachable through the service.

Analogy
Think of:
Docker as the method of packaging apps.
Images as blueprints.
Containers as the running app built from the image.Kubernetes as the manager/scheduler.
Pods as the container holders.
Services as the front doors to reach your running apps.
