• Use Case: Indexing speeds up search operations in large datasets, like searching for products in an e-commerce database.

• Tools: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Elasticsearch.

5. Message Queues
• Definition: A mechanism for asynchronous communication between system components, allowing one component to send a message and continue processing.

• Patterns:

Publish/Subscribe: A publisher sends messages to multiple subscribers.
FIFO: First-In-First-Out processing of messages.
• Use Case: Decoupling services in a microservices architecture, such as processing user signups asynchronously.

• Tools: RabbitMQ, Apache Kafka, AWS SQS.

6. Content Delivery Network (CDN)
• Definition: A geographically distributed network of servers that deliver content to users based on their location, improving speed and reducing latency.

• Key Features:

Caches static assets (images, videos, stylesheets) closer to users.
Handles traffic spikes by distributing requests across servers.
• Use Case: Video streaming services like Netflix use CDNs to ensure fast, uninterrupted playback.

• Providers: Akamai, Cloudflare, AWS CloudFront.

7. CAP Theorem
• Definition: States that in a distributed system, it is impossible to simultaneously achieve Consistency, Availability, and Partition Tolerance.

• Consistency: All nodes see the same data at the same time.

failing service temporarily.

• Use Case: Protects microservices from overloading during failures.

15. Distributed Transactions
• Definition: Ensuring consistency across multiple services in distributed systems.

• Techniques: Two-Phase Commit, Saga Pattern.

16. Proxies
• Definition: Intermediaries that forward client requests to servers.

• Types: Reverse proxies (e.g., NGINX), Forward proxies.

17. Data Consistency Models
• Definition: Defines how data changes are viewed across distributed systems.

• Models: Strong consistency, Eventual consistency.

18. Stateless vs. Stateful Services
• Definition: Stateless services do not retain session data; stateful ones do.

• Use Case: Stateless services scale better, while stateful services are used for transactions.

19. Fault Tolerance
• Definition: The ability of a system to continue operating even in the presence of failures.

20. Scalability
• Definition: The ability to handle increased load by adding resources.

• Types: Vertical (adding resources to a server) and Horizontal (adding more servers)
