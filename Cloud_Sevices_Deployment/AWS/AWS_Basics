1. Cloud Fundamentals
    Deployment Models: Public (AWS), Private (on-premise), and Hybrid (mix of both).
    Service Models:
      Cloud service models define what level of control and responsibility you get when using cloud computing. The three core models are IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS (with some modern extensions).

1️⃣ IaaS – Infrastructure as a Service
You manage: OS, runtime, middleware, apps, data
Cloud provider manages: Physical servers, storage, networking, virtualization

What you get
Virtual machines
Storage (block/object)
Networking (VPC, subnets, load balancers)

Examples
AWS: EC2, EBS, S3, VPC
Azure: Virtual Machines
GCP: Compute Engine

When to use
Full control over OS and software
Legacy applications
Custom networking/security requirements

Pros / Cons
✅ Maximum flexibility
❌ More operational overhead
------------
2️⃣ PaaS – Platform as a Service
You manage: Application code, data
Cloud provider manages: OS, runtime, scaling, patching, infra

What you get
Managed runtime environments
Built-in scaling and monitoring
CI/CD friendly platforms

Examples
AWS: Elastic Beanstalk, App Runner
Azure: App Service
GCP: App Engine

Heroku

When to use
Faster development & deployment

You don’t want to manage servers

Pros / Cons
✅ Faster time to market
❌ Less control over environment
------------
3️⃣ SaaS – Software as a Service
You manage: Only usage & configuration
Cloud provider manages: Everything else

What you get
Fully ready-to-use software
Access via browser or API

Examples
Gmail, Google Drive
Salesforce
Slack
Zoom

When to use
No development required

Business productivity tools

Pros / Cons
✅ Zero infrastructure management
❌ Least customization

❓ “What job does this do?”

Then classify it:

Does it RUN code?      → Compute
Does it STORE data?   → Storage
Does it CONNECT?      → Networking
Does it CONTROL access? → Security
Does it WATCH things? → Monitoring
Step 3️⃣ Map AWS services to these jobs
🖥️ Compute = “Who is doing the work?”
EC2 → Virtual machine doing work

Lambda → Code doing work

ECS/EKS → Containers doing work

👉 If CPU/RAM involved → Compute

📦 Storage = “Where is data kept?”
S3 → Files, images, backups

EBS → Disk for EC2

EFS → Shared folder

👉 If data survives after shutdown → Storage

🌐 Networking = “How things talk?”
VPC → Private network

Subnet → Smaller network

Load Balancer → Traffic distributor

Route table → Path rules

Internet Gateway → Internet access

👉 If packets move → Networking

🗄️ Database = “Structured storage”
RDS → SQL tables

DynamoDB → Key-value

(Still storage, but specialized)

🔐 Security = “Who is allowed?”
IAM → Permissions

Security Groups → Firewall

NACL → Network firewall

📊 Monitoring = “Who is watching?”
CloudWatch → Metrics, logs

CloudTrail → Audit logs

🧠 ONE MEMORY SENTENCE (Gold)
Repeat this until it feels boring:

Compute runs, Storage stores, Networking connects, Security protects, Monitoring watches
