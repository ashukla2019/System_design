Cloud Fundamentals
    Deployment Models: Public (AWS), Private (on-premise), and Hybrid (mix of both).
    Service Models:
      Cloud service models define what level of control and responsibility you get when using cloud computing. The three core models are IaaS, PaaS, 
      and SaaS (with some modern extensions).

Cloud Service Models:
More work → left
Less work → right

On-Prem → IaaS → PaaS → FaaS → BaaS → SaaS
  a) On-Prem (Everything is YOUR problem )
    You manage:
    Hardware
    OS
    Network
    App
    Security

    Example
    Company data center

    Memory: “I do everything”
------------------------
  b) IaaS — Infrastructure as a Service
    AWS gives:
    VM
    Storage
    Network
    
    You manage:
    OS
    App
    Patching

    Examples
    EC2
    EBS
    VPC
    Memory: “I manage OS”
-------------------------
  c) PaaS — Platform as a Service
    AWS manages:
    Hardware
    OS
    Runtime

    You manage:
    App code
    Data

    Examples
    Elastic Beanstalk
    
    App Runner
    RDS
    
    Memory: “I only write app code”
-----------------------------

   d) FaaS — Function as a Service
    AWS manages:
    Everything
    
    You manage:
    Function logic
    
    Example
    Lambda
    
    Memory: “I write a function”
------------------------
  e) BaaS — Backend as a Service
    AWS gives ready-made backend services:

    Database
    Auth
    Storage
    
    Examples
    DynamoDB
    Cognito
    S3
    
    Memory: “Backend is ready”
------------------------

f) SaaS — Software as a Service
  Just use the software

    AWS (or vendor) manages:
    Everything
    
    Examples
    Gmail
    Google Drive
    Salesforce
    Zoom
    
    Memory: “Just login and use”
---------------------------
Does it RUN code?      → Compute
Does it STORE data?   → Storage
Does it CONNECT?      → Networking
Does it CONTROL access? → Security
Does it WATCH things? → Monitoring

Map AWS services to these jobs:
a) Compute = “Who is doing the work?”
EC2 → Virtual machine doing work
Lambda → Code doing work
ECS/EKS → Containers doing work

If CPU/RAM involved → Compute
----------------------------------------------------------------------
b) Storage = “Where is data kept?”
S3 → Files, images, backups
EBS → Disk for EC2
EFS → Shared folder

If data survives after shutdown → Storage
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
c) Networking = “How things talk?”
VPC → Private network
Subnet → Smaller network
Load Balancer → Traffic distributor
Route table → Path rules
Internet Gateway → Internet access

If packets move → Networking
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
d) Database = “Structured storage”
RDS → SQL tables
DynamoDB → Key-value
(Still storage, but specialized)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
e) Security = “Who is allowed?”
IAM → Permissions
Security Groups → Firewall
NACL → Network firewall
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
f) Monitoring = “Who is watching?”
CloudWatch → Metrics, logs
CloudTrail → Audit logs

Compute runs, Storage stores, Networking connects, Security protects, Monitoring watches
