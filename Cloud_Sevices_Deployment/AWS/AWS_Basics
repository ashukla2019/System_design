1. Cloud Fundamentals
    Deployment Models: Public (AWS), Private (on-premise), and Hybrid (mix of both).
    Service Models:
      Cloud service models define what level of control and responsibility you get when using cloud computing. The three core models are IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS (with some modern extensions).


☁️ Cloud Service Models (ULTRA-EASY)
Ask ONE question:
How much work do I do?

More work → left
Less work → right

On-Prem → IaaS → PaaS → FaaS → BaaS → SaaS
🏢 On-Prem (Everything is YOUR problem 😅)
You manage:
Hardware
OS
Network
App
Security

Example
Company data center

🧠 Memory: “I do everything”
------------------------
🧱 IaaS — Infrastructure as a Service
AWS gives:
VM
Storage
Network

You manage:
OS
App
Patching

✅ Examples
EC2
EBS
VPC
🧠 Memory: “I manage OS”
-------------------------
🚧 PaaS — Platform as a Service
AWS manages:

Hardware

OS

Runtime

You manage:

App code

Data

✅ Examples
Elastic Beanstalk

App Runner

RDS

🧠 Memory: “I only write app code”
-----------------------------

⚡ FaaS — Function as a Service
AWS manages:
Everything

You manage:
Function logic

✅ Example
Lambda

🧠 Memory: “I write a function”
------------------------
🔧 BaaS — Backend as a Service
AWS gives ready-made backend services:

Database
Auth
Storage

✅ Examples
DynamoDB
Cognito
S3

🧠 Memory: “Backend is ready”
------------------------

🧑‍💼 SaaS — Software as a Service
👉 Just use the software

AWS (or vendor) manages:
Everything

✅ Examples
Gmail
Google Drive
Salesforce
Zoom

🧠 Memory: “Just login and use”
---------------------------
Does it RUN code?      → Compute
Does it STORE data?   → Storage
Does it CONNECT?      → Networking
Does it CONTROL access? → Security
Does it WATCH things? → Monitoring
Step 3️⃣ Map AWS services to these jobs
🖥️ Compute = “Who is doing the work?”
EC2 → Virtual machine doing work

Lambda → Code doing work

ECS/EKS → Containers doing work

👉 If CPU/RAM involved → Compute

📦 Storage = “Where is data kept?”
S3 → Files, images, backups

EBS → Disk for EC2

EFS → Shared folder

👉 If data survives after shutdown → Storage

🌐 Networking = “How things talk?”
VPC → Private network

Subnet → Smaller network

Load Balancer → Traffic distributor

Route table → Path rules

Internet Gateway → Internet access

👉 If packets move → Networking

🗄️ Database = “Structured storage”
RDS → SQL tables

DynamoDB → Key-value

(Still storage, but specialized)

🔐 Security = “Who is allowed?”
IAM → Permissions

Security Groups → Firewall

NACL → Network firewall

📊 Monitoring = “Who is watching?”
CloudWatch → Metrics, logs

CloudTrail → Audit logs

🧠 ONE MEMORY SENTENCE (Gold)
Repeat this until it feels boring:

Compute runs, Storage stores, Networking connects, Security protects, Monitoring watches
