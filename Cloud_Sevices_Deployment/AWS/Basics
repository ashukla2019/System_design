1. Cloud Fundamentals
    Deployment Models: Public (AWS), Private (on-premise), and Hybrid (mix of both).
    Service Models:
        IaaS: Infrastructure (EC2, S3) where you manage OS and apps.
        PaaS: Platform (Elastic Beanstalk) where you only manage code.
        SaaS: Finished software (Gmail, Microsoft 365).
    Global Infrastructure: AWS is divided into Regions (geographic areas) and Availability Zones (AZs) 
    (isolated data centers within regions). 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Compute Services (The Brain)
    Amazon EC2: Resizable virtual servers. Know the pricing models: On-Demand (pay-per-use), Reserved 
    (1–3 year commitment for 72% savings), and Spot (spare capacity at high discounts).
    AWS Lambda: Serverless compute that runs code only when triggered by events (e.g., file upload to S3).
    Elastic Beanstalk: An orchestration service that automates deployment, scaling, and load balancing for web apps. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Storage & Databases (The Memory)
    Amazon S3: Scalable object storage for files. Offers 99.999999999% durability.
    Amazon EBS: Persistent block storage volumes for EC2 (like a hard drive).
    Databases:
        RDS: Managed relational databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle).
        DynamoDB: Fully managed NoSQL database for high-speed, unstructured data.
        Aurora: High-performance, AWS-native relational database compatible with MySQL/PostgreSQL. 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. Networking & Content Delivery
    Amazon VPC: Your private, isolated section of the AWS cloud. Key components: Subnets, Route Tables, and Internet Gateways.
    Route 53: A highly available Domain Name System (DNS) for domain registration and traffic routing.
    CloudFront: Content Delivery Network (CDN) that speeds up website delivery using global "Edge Locations".
    Elastic Load Balancing (ELB): Distributes incoming traffic across multiple targets (like EC2 instances) to ensure high availability. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. Security & Management

    AWS IAM: Manage user access. Always follow the Principle of Least Privilege (give only the access needed).
    CloudWatch: Monitoring service for resources and applications; used to set alarms (e.g., if CPU > 80%).
    CloudTrail: Audit logs of every action taken in your AWS account (who did what and when).
    AWS Artifact: Portal for on-demand access to AWS compliance reports (PCI, SOC, ISO)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 1: The AWS Account (The Hotel Brand)
The Account is the topmost container. It is the legal and financial entity.

    Analogy: This is the "Marriott" or "Hilton" brand level.
    What happens here: This is where you pay the bill and decide who (IAM Users) has the keycards to enter the buildings.
    Expert Rule: Everything you do in AWS happens inside an Account.

Step 2: The Region (The City)
Inside your Account, you must choose a Region. Regions are physical locations around the world.

    Analogy: This is choosing to build in "New York" or "London."
    What fits here: You decide where your data physically sits for speed (latency) or laws (compliance).
    Expert Rule: You can have multiple VPCs in one Region, but a VPC cannot leave its city (Region).

Step 3: The VPC (The Hotel Building)
Inside a Region, you build a VPC (Virtual Private Cloud). This is your private, fenced-in network.

    Analogy: This is the physical Hotel Building. It has a fence around it. No one can get in unless you build a front door (Internet Gateway).
    What fits here: You define the private IP addresses for the whole building (e.g., 10.0.0.0/16).
    Expert Rule: You are the architect of the building. You decide how many floors and rooms it has.

Step 4: The Subnet (The Floor/Room)
Inside your VPC building, you divide the space into Subnets.

    Analogy: These are the Floors of the hotel.
        Public Subnet: The Lobby. Anyone from the street (Internet) can walk in.
        Private Subnet: The Guest Rooms. You need special permission/security to get there; they are not open to the street.
    What fits here: Subnets are tied to a specific Availability Zone (AZ) (think of AZs as separate power grids or wings of the hotel for safety).
    Expert Rule: You put your sensitive stuff (Databases) in the private "rooms" and your website in the "lobby."

Step 5: The Resource (The Guest/Furniture)
Finally, you place the actual Resources inside the Subnets.

    Analogy: This is the Guest (EC2 Instance) or the Safe (Database) inside the room.
    What happens here: The resource gets a specific "Room Number" (Private IP address) from the Subnet it lives in.
    Expert Rule: A resource like an EC2 server must live in one specific Subnet.

The Full "Logic Chain" in One Sentence:

    "My AWS Account owns a Region (City), where I built a VPC (Building), divided into Subnets (Floors), to hold my EC2 Resources (Guests)."

Summary Table for 2025 Mastery
Layer

Technical Name	Who/What lives here?
Level 1	Account	Billing, IAM Users, Security Policies.
Level 2	Region	The physical location (e.g., us-east-1).
Level 3	VPC	Your private IP range and network rules.
Level 4	Subnet	Public or Private access rules (tied to an AZ).
Level 5	Resource	EC2, RDS (Databases), Load Balancers.
Wait, what about S3?
Some resources (like S3 Buckets) are "Global/Regional." They don't live in a VPC or Subnet. Think of S3 as a Storage Warehouse outside the hotel that the hotel guests can send boxes to for safekeeping.
