1. What is a Cluster?
A cluster is a group of computers (nodes) working together as if they were one system.

The nodes share workloads and resources.

They are often connected over a local or high-speed network.

Used for high performance, parallel processing, or high availability.

Examples:

Kubernetes cluster (multiple machines running containers together)

Hadoop cluster (for distributed data processing)

HPC (High-Performance Computing) clusters

Key traits:

Typically tightly coupled hardware.

Can be on-premises or in the cloud.

Requires manual setup and maintenance unless managed by a service.

2. What is the Cloud?
The cloud is a broad term for computing resources (servers, storage, databases, networking, etc.) delivered over the internet by providers like AWS, Azure, or GCP.

You rent computing power instead of buying servers.

Offers on-demand scaling, pay-as-you-go pricing, and managed services.

Can include clusters â€” but clusters are just one part of it.

Examples:

AWS EC2 (virtual servers)

Azure Blob Storage

Google BigQuery

Managed Kubernetes (EKS, AKS, GKE)

Key traits:

Abstracts hardware management.

Provides elasticity (scale up/down as needed).

Offers global reach.
