Both AWS (Amazon Web Services) and Azure (Microsoft Azure) are cloud platforms that provide a wide range of services. These platforms can be grouped into categories:

AWS Platform (Amazon Web Services)
AWS is divided into service families. Major categories include:

1) Compute:
EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)
Lambda (serverless)
ECS / EKS (containers, Kubernetes)
Elastic Beanstalk
Lightsail

2) Storage

EBS (Elastic Block Store)
EFS (Elastic File System)
Glacier (archival storage)

3) Networking & Content Delivery
VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)
Route 53 (DNS)
CloudFront (CDN)
API Gateway
Direct Connect

4) Databases
RDS (Relational Database Service)
DynamoDB (NoSQL)
Redshift (Data warehouse)
Aurora
ElastiCache

5) Security & Identity
IAM (Identity and Access Management)
KMS (Key Management Service)
Cognito
Shield / WAF

6) Monitoring & Management
CloudWatch
CloudTrail
Config
Systems Manager

7) Analytics, AI & ML

StageMaker
Kinesis

8) DevOps & CI/CD
CodeBuild, CodePipeline, CodeDeploy
CloudFormation (infrastructure as code)
OpsWorks

9) Other Services
IoT Core
WorkSpaces (VDI)
AppStream

Azure Platform (Microsoft Azure)
Azure provides similar categories (names differ but functions overlap):

1) Compute
Virtual Machines (VMs)
Azure Functions (serverless)
Azure App Service
AKS (Azure Kubernetes Service)
Virtual Desktop

2) Storage
Blob Storage
Disk Storage
File Storage
Archive Storage

3) Networking
Virtual Network (VNet)
Azure Load Balancer
Application Gateway / Front Door
Azure CDN
ExpressRoute

4) Databases
Azure SQL Database
Cosmos DB (NoSQL)
PostgreSQL / MySQL services
Synapse Analytics (data warehouse)
Cache for Redis

5) Identity & Security
Azure Active Directory (AAD)
Key Vault
Security Center / Defender
Firewall / DDoS Protection

6) Management & Monitoring
Azure Monitor
Log Analytics
Application Insights
Cost Management

Analytics, AI & ML

7) Azure Data Lake
Databricks
Cognitive Services (Vision, Speech, etc.)
Machine Learning Studio

8) DevOps & IaC
Azure DevOps (Repos, Pipelines, Boards)
ARM Templates / Bicep
GitHub Actions (Microsoft owns GitHub)

9) Other Services
IoT Hub
Logic Apps / Event Grid
Power BI integration
Microsoft 365 integration

Key Difference
AWS is broader and slightly older, with more services (over 200).

Azure integrates tightly with Microsoft ecosystem (Windows, Active Directory, Office 365).
