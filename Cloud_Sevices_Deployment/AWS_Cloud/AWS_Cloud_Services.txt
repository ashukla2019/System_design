What are EC2 , VPC and IAM etc
These are core AWS services you’ll encounter often when working with infrastructure, especially when deploying clusters. Here's a simplified breakdown:

✅ 1. EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) – Your Virtual Machines
🖥️ What is it?
EC2 is a virtual server in AWS where you can run applications, host websites, or deploy services.

🔍 Key Features:
Choose instance types (CPU, memory, GPU, etc.)

Connect via SSH
Install any OS (Linux, Windows, etc.)
Pay as you use (per second or hour)
Think of EC2 as your cloud-based computer.

✅ 2. VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) – Your Network in the Cloud
🌐 What is it?
A VPC is your own private network in AWS where you can place EC2 instances, databases, etc.

🔍 Key Features:
You define IP address ranges
Create subnets (public or private)
Add security groups (firewall rules)
Use internet gateways, NATs, and route tables

Think of VPC as your virtual data center in AWS.

✅ 3. IAM (Identity and Access Management) – Permissions & Access
🔐 What is it?
IAM manages who can do what in your AWS environment.

🔍 Key Features:
Create users, groups, and roles
Assign permissions using IAM policies
Secure access using MFA and access keys
Think of IAM as the security guard for your cloud.

✅ 4. S3 (Simple Storage Service) – Cloud Storage
📦 What is it?
S3 is an object-based storage service. You can store files, logs, backups, binaries, etc.

🔍 Key Features:
Store files as objects in buckets
Versioning, encryption, lifecycle rules
Scalable and durable (99.999999999%)

Think of S3 as your infinite USB drive in the cloud.

✅ 5. EBS (Elastic Block Store) – Storage for EC2
💽 What is it?
EBS is block storage that attaches to EC2 instances (like a virtual hard disk).

Think of EBS as your virtual SSD/HDD for EC2.

✅ 6. RDS (Relational Database Service) – Managed Databases
🗃️ What is it?
RDS lets you run managed databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, etc.

Think of RDS as database-as-a-service with backups, scaling, and patching handled for you.
