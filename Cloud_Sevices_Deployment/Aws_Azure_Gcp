🔹 How to Remember AWS & Azure CLI Categories
1. Think Like a Cloud Architecture Diagram
Every cloud workload usually has these building blocks:

Compute → Where apps run (VMs, containers, functions)

Storage → Where data is stored (S3/Blob, disks)

Network → How things connect (VPC/VNet, subnets, firewalls)

Database → Specialized storage (RDS/SQL, DynamoDB/CosmosDB)

Identity & Access → Who can do what (IAM/Azure AD, roles, policies)

Monitoring → Logs, metrics, alerts (CloudWatch/Azure Monitor)

Management → Resource groups/stacks, accounts, billing
---------------------------------
2. Mnemonic Trick (C-S-N-D-I-M-M)
Remember categories in this order:

🔹 Compute
🔹 Storage
🔹 Network
🔹 Database
🔹 Identity
🔹 Monitoring
🔹 Management

👉 Mnemonic: “Cloud Services Need Daily Integrated Managed Monitoring”

🔹 Azure Hierarchy in Detail
Azure Account (identity / login)
   └── Subscription (billing boundary, quota limits, RBAC scope)
         └── Resource Group (logical container for lifecycle management)
               └── Virtual Network (VNet = isolated private network space)
                     └── Subnet (smaller IP segment of VNet)
                           └── Resources (VMs, NICs, DBs, Storage, etc.)
1️⃣ Azure Account
Your identity (email or service principal).

Linked to Azure Active Directory.

Can own multiple subscriptions.

2️⃣ Subscription
Billing unit — all usage inside is billed here.

Also defines limits (cores, storage, etc.).

Example: Dev-Sub, Prod-Sub.

3️⃣ Resource Group
Logical grouping of resources for lifecycle management.

Delete RG → all resources inside are deleted.

Can contain: VNets, VMs, DBs, Storage accounts, etc.

4️⃣ Virtual Network (VNet)
Network boundary inside a resource group.

Defines IP address space (like 10.0.0.0/16).

Can connect to other VNets, on-prem, or internet.

5️⃣ Subnet
Smaller CIDR blocks inside a VNet.

Segregates resources logically (e.g., Web Tier, App Tier, DB Tier).

Example:

10.0.1.0/24 → Web servers

10.0.2.0/24 → Databases

6️⃣ Resources
Actual services running inside the subnet.

Examples:

VMs (Compute)

NICs (Networking)

DBs (Databases)

Storage Accounts (Storage)

👉 A good way to remember is:

Account → Subscription → Resource Group → VNet → Subnet → Resources

👉 If you visualize a 3-tier app (Web → App → DB), you naturally cover Compute, Network, Storage, Database. Then sprinkle Identity, Monitoring, and Management around it.

🔹 Azure Resource Hierarchy
Azure Account

Your Azure subscription is tied to an Azure Account (email/identity).

One account can have multiple subscriptions.

Each subscription is like a billing and security boundary.

Subscription

The subscription is the container for all resources.

You pay for everything inside a subscription.

Example: Dev Subscription, Prod Subscription.

Resource Group (RG)

A logical container inside a subscription.

Groups resources (VMs, VNets, Storage Accounts, Databases, etc.) that share the same lifecycle.

You can deploy, manage, and delete resources as a unit.

Example: MyApp-RG might contain:

2 VMs

1 VNet

1 Subnet

1 Storage Account

Virtual Network (VNet)

A network boundary within a resource group.

Works like a VPC in AWS.

Must belong to 1 resource group (but resources in other groups can still connect if allowed).

Example: MyVnet inside MyApp-RG.

Subnet

A slice of the VNet’s address space.

VMs, Databases, App Services, etc., connect into subnets.

Example:

10.0.0.0/16 = VNet address space

10.0.1.0/24 = Subnet A (Web Tier)

10.0.2.0/24 = Subnet B (DB Tier)

🔗 How They Link Together
Azure Account (identity)
   └── Subscription (billing boundary)
         └── Resource Group (logical container)
               └── Virtual Network (isolated network boundary)
                     └── Subnet (smaller IP range inside VNet)
                           └── Resources (VMs, DBs, NICs, etc.)
🔹 Quick AWS Analogy
Azure Subscription ≈ AWS Account

Azure Resource Group ≈ AWS Tags / CloudFormation Stack (logical grouping, not billing)

Azure VNet ≈ AWS VPC

Azure Subnet ≈ AWS Subnet

👉 So in short:

You start with Account → Subscription → Resource Group.

Inside RG you put a VNet → Subnet → Resources (VMs, DBs, etc.).

Azure Account (identity)
   └── Subscription (billing boundary)
         └── Resource Group (logical container)
               └── Virtual Network (isolated network boundary)
                     └── Subnet (smaller IP range inside VNet)
                           └── Resources (VMs, DBs, NICs, etc.)

Exactly ✅ — you’ve nailed the hierarchy. Let me expand that with a bit more context on each level, so you can keep the picture in your head:

-----------------------------
🔹 What is a VNet (Virtual Network)?
A Virtual Network (VNet) in Azure is like your private data center network inside Azure.

It defines your own IP address space (using private IP ranges like 10.x.x.x, 172.x.x.x, or 192.168.x.x).

It lets your Azure resources (VMs, databases, etc.) communicate securely with each other.

It can connect to other VNets, on-premises networks (via VPN), or the Internet.

Think of a VNet as a container for subnets and network resources.

🔹 What is a Subnet?
A Subnet (sub-network) is a smaller segment of your VNet’s IP space.

It divides your VNet into logical sections.

Each subnet can host different resources (e.g., Web Tier, App Tier, DB Tier).

You can attach different Network Security Groups (NSGs) or Route Tables to each subnet for control.

🔹 Example Scenario
Let’s build a small web application architecture in Azure:

Virtual Network (VNet) : 10.0.0.0/16
--------------------------------------

VNet: MyApp-VNet (10.0.0.0/16)
│
├── Subnet: Web-Subnet (10.0.1.0/24)
│     └── VM-Web1, VM-Web2
│
├── Subnet: App-Subnet (10.0.2.0/24)
│     └── VM-App1, VM-App2
│
├── Subnet: DB-Subnet (10.0.3.0/24)
│     └── Azure SQL Database
│
└── Subnet: Mgmt-Subnet (10.0.4.0/24)
      └── Bastion Host / Jumpbox
