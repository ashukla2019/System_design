ðŸ”¹ What is a Cluster?
A cluster is a group of interconnected nodes (computers or servers) that:

Work together to run applications.
Share workload (load balancing).
Provide backup for each other (failover).
Appear to users as a single system.

ðŸ”¹ Cluster Deployment = How the Cluster is Set Up
Cluster deployment involves:

Installing and configuring the cluster software.
Defining how nodes communicate.
Deploying services or containers on top of the cluster (like Kubernetes pods).
Managing storage, networking, and security across the cluster.

ðŸ”¹ Types of Cluster Deployments
High Availability (HA) Cluster

Ensures services keep running even if one or more nodes fail.

Example: Load balancer + redundant database nodes.

Load Balancing Cluster
Distributes user requests evenly across nodes.

Improves performance and response time.

Compute Cluster
For heavy computations (e.g., scientific simulations).

Nodes work in parallel.

Storage Cluster
Provides distributed, redundant storage.

Example: GlusterFS, Ceph.

Container Orchestration Cluster

Manages containers (like Docker) using platforms like:
Kubernetes
Docker Swarm
OpenShift
