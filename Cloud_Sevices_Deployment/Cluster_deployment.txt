What was need of clusters and cloud providers simple linkable story of fact

1. Single Computers (Past)
Long ago, businesses ran everything on one big server (a mainframe or a large machine).

Problem: If that one machine failed → everything stopped. Also, it couldn’t handle too many users.

2. Clusters (First Step)
To solve this, companies started connecting multiple servers together → called a cluster.

Benefit:

If one server fails, others keep working (high availability).

Workload is shared among machines (scalability).

Example: A shopping site during sales needs more servers to handle traffic, so a cluster balances it.

3. Data Centers (Scaling Up)
As demand grew, companies built huge buildings full of clusters → data centers.

Problem:

Very expensive to buy servers, power, cooling, and staff.

Most of the time, servers sat idle (wasted money).

4. Cloud Providers (Next Big Step)
Companies like AWS, Azure, GCP said:

“Instead of everyone buying and maintaining their own clusters, we’ll build giant data centers and rent out servers on demand.”

Benefits:
Pay only for what you use.
Instantly scale up or down.
No need to manage physical machines.

✅ So the story goes like this:
One computer → clusters (more reliability + scalability) → data centers (centralized clusters) → cloud providers (on-demand, shared data centers).

🔹 What is a Cluster?
A cluster is a group of interconnected nodes (computers or servers) that:

Work together to run applications.
Share workload (load balancing).
Provide backup for each other (failover).
Appear to users as a single system.

🔹 Cluster Deployment = How the Cluster is Set Up
Cluster deployment involves:

Installing and configuring the cluster software.
Defining how nodes communicate.
Deploying services or containers on top of the cluster (like Kubernetes pods).
Managing storage, networking, and security across the cluster.

🔹 Types of Cluster Deployments
High Availability (HA) Cluster

Ensures services keep running even if one or more nodes fail.

Example: Load balancer + redundant database nodes.

Load Balancing Cluster
Distributes user requests evenly across nodes.

Improves performance and response time.

Compute Cluster
For heavy computations (e.g., scientific simulations).

Nodes work in parallel.

Storage Cluster
Provides distributed, redundant storage.

Example: GlusterFS, Ceph.

Container Orchestration Cluster

Manages containers (like Docker) using platforms like:
Kubernetes
Docker Swarm
OpenShift
