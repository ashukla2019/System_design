3-2-1 backup rule:
1) Three Copies: The rule mandates creating at least three copies of your data. This includes the original data and at least two backup copies.
2) Two Different Storage Types:
The backups should be stored on two different types of storage media (e.g., a local hard drive and cloud storage).
3) One Off-Site Copy:
At least one copy of your data must be stored off-site (either physically or in the cloud) to protect against physical disasters or site-specific failures.
