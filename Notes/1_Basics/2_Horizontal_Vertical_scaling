If there are many users to interact with server on cloud, it might happen that we are not able to handle all requests.
Solutions:
1) Buy big machine(Vertical scaling)
2) Buy more machines(Horizontal scaling)

Horizontal scaling--------------------------------------------------------Vertical scaling
1) Load balancing is required.                                            NA
2) Resiliant                                                              Single point of failure
3) Network call through RPC(slow)                                         IPC calls faster
4) Data Inconsistency                                                     Consistency
5) Scale well                                                             hardware limit
