Asynchronous APIs are widely utilized in modern development because of their ability to handle multiple requests simultaneously,
which improves the overall user experience. In this article, we will look into asynchronous APIs, their advantages, and how to 
implement them.

What are Asynchronous APIs?
Asynchronous APIs are a sort of web service that allows users to conduct multiple requests at the same time without waiting for 
the previous request to execute. This means that the server may process multiple requests at the same time, decreasing the API’s
overall response time. Asynchronous APIs are typically utilized in scenarios involving a large number of requests or lengthy processing
durations, such as data-intensive apps.


Advantages of Asynchronous APIs:
Improved Performance: multiple requests can be handled, thereby improving the overall performance of the application.
Scalability: Asynchronous APIs are extremely scalable, which implies that as the application expands, they can manage a rising number of requests. This is due to the server’s ability to handle requests in parallel, reducing total response time.
Resource Efficiency: Asynchronous APIs require fewer resources to handle multiple requests compared to synchronous APIs. This means that developers can build more efficient and cost-effective applications.

Implementation of Asynchronous APIs:
Callbacks
Promises
Async/Await
Using setTimeout()
