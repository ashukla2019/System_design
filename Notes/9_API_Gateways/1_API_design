What is API design?
API design is the process of making intentional decisions about how an API will expose data and functionality to its consumers. 
A successful API design describes the API's endpoints, methods, and resources in a standardized specification format.

The API design process benefits both consumers and producers by ensuring that APIs support business objectives while remaining easy to use,
adaptable, testable, and well-documented. API design should occur early in the API lifecycle in order to achieve alignment among key 
stakeholders and to help teams identify issues before they become ingrained. API design is also an important part of an effective
API governance strategy, as it helps teams standardize API patterns that can be reused across their organization.
