Access Control Lists (ACLs): ACLs are lists that define the actions that can be performed on objects. 
They can be user-based (a specific user has certain permissions), role-based (users with a particular role have certain
permissions), or group-based (a group of users or resources have certain permissions). 
ACLs are grouped together to form the access control matrix of the system.

Rule Engines: Rule engines involve using a set of rules, often implemented as if statements, to determine whether a user or 
resource has permission to perform an action. Rule engines are useful for handling complex authorization requirements and
can handle multiple objects and rules efficiently. They are also helpful in centralizing common rules and allowing easy 
rule modifications without modifying ACLs.

Secret Keys: Secret keys or client keys are an additional layer of security for authentication and authorization. 
They involve authenticating using a key or token rather than a username and password. This mechanism provides an extra
level of security but is not considered ideal on its own.

These authorization mechanisms differ in their approach and can be used depending on the specific requirements of
the system. They help define and enforce permissions for users and resources, ensuring that only authorized actions 
are performed.
