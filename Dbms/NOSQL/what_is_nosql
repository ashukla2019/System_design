NoSQL Database Characteristics:
BASE: The "Anti-ACID" Model (used in many NoSQL systems)
BASE Property	            Description
Basically Available	      System guarantees availability, even during failures
Soft state	               System state may change over time, even without input (due to eventual consistency)
Eventually consistent	    Data becomes consistent over time, not instantly

1) Non-relational/Schema-less:NoSQL databases do not require fixed schemas—you can store unstructured, semi-structured, 
   or structured data.Fields can vary from one document to another (in document stores like MongoDB).

2) High Scalability (Horizontal Scaling)
   Designed to scale out by adding more servers (nodes), unlike SQL databases that primarily scale up.

3) High Availability and Partition Tolerance (CAP theorem)
   Often prefer Availability + Partition    Tolerance, possibly at the cost of  Consistency.

4) Support for Big Data and Real-Time Apps

Excellent for handling large volumes of data, high-velocity reads/writes, and real-time analytics.

5) Variety of Data Models:
 NoSQL includes different types of databases:
 Document-based (e.g., MongoDB)
 Key-Value stores (e.g., Redis, DynamoDB)
 Column-family (e.g., Cassandra, HBase)
 Graph-based (e.g., Neo4j)

6) Flexible Data Types and Storage
  Can store JSON, XML, binary, blobs, etc.
  Eventual Consistency (in many systems)

Data changes may take time to propagate to all nodes. (Not strictly ACID, but can be BASE: Basically Available, Soft state, Eventually consistent.)
Built-in Sharding and Replication
Automatic data distribution across nodes and support for data redundancy.
