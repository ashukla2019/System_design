SQL Database Characteristics and Supported Operations
Characteristics of SQL Databases:

1) Relational Structure: Data is stored in tables (relations) composed of rows and columns.Tables can be linked using foreign keys to maintain referential integrity.

2) Structured Query Language (SQL):SQL is the standard language used to interact with relational databases.

3) ACID Properties:
   Atomicity: All operations in a transaction   are completed; otherwise, none are.

   Consistency: The database remains in a valid state before and after transactions.

   Isolation: Transactions do not interfere with each other.

   Durability: Once a transaction is committed, it is permanently saved.

4) Schema-Based: SQL databases require a predefined schema, which specifies the structure of data.

5) Data Integrity Constraints:Enforces rules like NOT NULL, UNIQUE, PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, CHECK.

6) Support for TransactionsMultiple operations can be grouped into a transaction that is either fully executed or rolled back.

7) Normalized Data:Data is typically normalized to reduce redundancy and improve consistency.

8) Scalability:Vertical scaling (more CPU/RAM) is commonly used. Horizontal scaling is limited compared to NoSQL.

9) Concurrency Control:SQL databases handle multiple users by implementing locks and concurrency protocols.

🛠️ Supported SQL Operations
1. Data Definition Language (DDL)
Used to define and modify database structures:

Command	Description
CREATE	Create databases, tables, indexes, views
ALTER	Modify existing database objects
DROP	Delete database objects
TRUNCATE	Quickly remove all records from a table (no rollback)

2. Data Manipulation Language (DML)
Used to manipulate data within tables:

Command	Description
SELECT	Retrieve data
INSERT	Add new records
UPDATE	Modify existing records
DELETE	Remove records

3. Data Control Language (DCL)
Used to control access to data:

Command	Description
GRANT	Provide user access privileges
REVOKE	Remove user access privileges

4. Transaction Control Language (TCL)
Used to manage transactions:

Command	Description
BEGIN / START TRANSACTION	Begin a transaction
COMMIT	Save changes made during the transaction
ROLLBACK	Undo changes since the last commit
SAVEPOINT	Set a point within a transaction to roll back to

5. Joins and Queries
SQL supports powerful querying through:

INNER JOIN
LEFT/RIGHT JOIN
FULL OUTER JOIN
SELF JOIN
UNION / INTERSECT / EXCEPT
GROUP BY, HAVING, ORDER BY
Subqueries and nested SELECTs


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   

Example Tables
Table: Customers
id	name
1	Alice
2	Bob
3	Carol

Table: Orders
id	customer_id	item
1	1	Book
2	1	Pen
3	2	Laptop
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
INNER JOIN
Keeps only matching rows in both tables.

Query
SELECT Customers.name, Orders.item
FROM Customers
INNER JOIN Orders ON Customers.id = Orders.customer_id;

Result
name	item
Alice	Book
Alice	Pen
Bob	Laptop

Carol has no orders → excluded.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
LEFT JOIN
Keeps ALL rows from the left table, even if no match.

Query
SELECT Customers.name, Orders.item
FROM Customers
LEFT JOIN Orders ON Customers.id = Orders.customer_id;

Result
name	item
Alice	Book
Alice	Pen
Bob	Laptop
Carol	NULL

Carol is included, item is NULL.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RIGHT JOIN
Keeps ALL rows from the right table, even if no match.

Query
SELECT Customers.name, Orders.item
FROM Customers
RIGHT JOIN Orders ON Customers.id = Orders.customer_id;

Result
Same as INNER JOIN here (because every order has a matching customer).

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
FULL OUTER JOIN
Keeps ALL rows from both tables.

If an order existed for a non-existent customer, it would show too.
Example (conceptual)
SELECT Customers.name, Orders.item
FROM Customers
FULL OUTER JOIN Orders ON Customers.id = Orders.customer_id;

Result (with our data)
name	item
Alice	Book
Alice	Pen
Bob	Laptop
Carol	NULL

(If Orders had an order with customer_id = 999, it would appear with name = NULL)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SELF JOIN
Table joined with itself.

Example: list pairs of customers where one has a greater id.

SELECT A.name AS person1, B.name AS person2
FROM Customers A
JOIN Customers B ON A.id < B.id;

Result
person1	person2
Alice	Bob
Alice	Carol
Bob	Carol

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
UNION / INTERSECT / EXCEPT
Let’s use two simple sets:

Table: A
value
1
2
3
Table: B
value
2
3
4
UNION
Combines rows → removes duplicates.

SELECT value FROM A
UNION
SELECT value FROM B;


Result:

value
1
2
3
4

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
INTERSECT
Only values present in BOTH tables.

SELECT value FROM A
INTERSECT
SELECT value FROM B;

Result:

value
2
3
EXCEPT (or MINUS)

Values in A that are not in B.

SELECT value FROM A
EXCEPT
SELECT value FROM B;

Result:

value
1

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
GROUP BY, HAVING, ORDER BY

Using the Orders table:

id	customer_id	item
1	1	Book
2	1	Pen
3	2	Laptop
GROUP BY

Group rows and compute aggregates.

SELECT customer_id, COUNT(*) AS total_orders
FROM Orders
GROUP BY customer_id;


Result:

customer_id	total_orders
1	2
2	1
HAVING

Filter on aggregated values (WHERE cannot do this).

SELECT customer_id, COUNT(*) AS total_orders
FROM Orders
GROUP BY customer_id
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;


Result:

customer_id	total_orders
1	2

Only customers with more than 1 order.

ORDER BY

Sort results.

SELECT name
FROM Customers
ORDER BY name DESC;


Result:

name
Carol
Bob
Alice
