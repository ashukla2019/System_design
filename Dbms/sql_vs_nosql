Why SQL Databases Are “Relational”
1. They use the Relational Model (mathematical concept)
A relation = a table
A tuple = a row
An attribute = a column

So a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) is one that stores data in relations (tables) and is operated using set theory + predicate logic.

2. Data is organized in tables with key constraints
Relational DBs use:
Primary keys (unique identifier)
Foreign keys (to maintain referential integrity)
Unique constraints
Check constraints

Indexes

These rules ensure accuracy, consistency, integrity — the core idea of relational databases.

3. Relationships between tables are defined logically
Because the model uses keys, tables can be connected:

1 → 1

1 → many

many → many

But this is not the reason it’s called relational — this is just a feature that relational design enables.

4. SQL is based on relational algebra & relational calculus
SQL lets you query data using operations from relational algebra, such as:

SELECT (projection)

WHERE (selection)

JOIN (Cartesian product + filtering)

GROUP BY (aggregation)

UNION, INTERSECT, MINUS

These operations treat tables as sets — this is why relational DBs are extremely powerful for querying.

5. RDBMS guarantees ACID properties
Relational DB design enforces:

Atomicity

Consistency

Isolation

Durability

These make SQL databases reliable for financial, banking, enterprise systems.

✔️ Summary in One Line
SQL databases are called relational because:

➡️ They store data as relations (tables) and use mathematical relational theory to manage and query it.

If you want, I can also explain:
✔️ Why NoSQL databases are non-relational
✔️ When to use SQL vs NoSQL
✔️ How relationships actually work in RDBMS (PK/FK diagrams)

Great — here is the full, clear comparison explaining why SQL is relational, why NoSQL is non-relational, and when to use each.

✅ 1. Why SQL Is Relational
SQL DBs (MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server) follow:

➤ Relational Model = Data stored in relations (tables)
A relation = a table.
A tuple = a row.
An attribute = a column.

This mathematical model forces rules that guarantee correctness.

➤ Tables are connected using keys
Primary Key (PK): identifies each row uniquely

Foreign Key (FK): references PK in another table

This creates logical relationships (1-1, 1-M, M-M)

➤ Queries based on relational algebra
SQL operations (JOIN, SELECT, UNION, GROUP BY) are derived from relational algebra → working with data as sets.

➤ ACID transactions
SQL DBs guarantee:

Consistency

Reliability

Data integrity

This is why banks, hospitals, inventory systems rely on SQL.

❌ 2. Why NoSQL Is Non-Relational
NoSQL = “Not Only SQL” → it doesn’t use the relational model, and often:

➤ No tables
➤ No fixed schema
➤ No strict foreign keys
➤ No relational algebra
Depending on the type, data is stored as:

Document stores (MongoDB → JSON-like)

Key-value stores (Redis)

Column-family stores (Cassandra)

Graph databases (Neo4j)

These structures are not based on relations, so they are non-relational.

📌 3. SQL vs NoSQL: When to Use Which?
✔️ Use SQL When:
You need ACID transactions

Strong data consistency

Complex JOINs / relational queries

Defined schema (structured data)

Use cases:

Banking

Inventory

ERP systems

Healthcare

Accounting

Order management

✔️ Use NoSQL When:
You need massive horizontal scalability

Flexible schema / unstructured data

High write throughput

Real-time analytics or caching

Common use cases:
NoSQL Type	Best For
MongoDB (Document)	User profiles, catalogs, logs, CMS
Redis (Key-value)	Caching, sessions, leaderboard
Cassandra (Column-family)	High write scale (IoT, telemetry)
Neo4j (Graph)	Social networks, recommendation graphs
