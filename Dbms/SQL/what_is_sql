SQL Database Characteristics and Supported Operations
Characteristics of SQL Databases:

1) Relational Structure: Data is stored in tables (relations) composed of rows and columns.Tables can be linked using foreign keys to maintain referential integrity.

2) Structured Query Language (SQL):SQL is the standard language used to interact with relational databases.

3) ACID Properties:
   Atomicity: All operations in a transaction   are completed; otherwise, none are.

   Consistency: The database remains in a valid state before and after transactions.

   Isolation: Transactions do not interfere with each other.

   Durability: Once a transaction is committed, it is permanently saved.

4) Schema-Based: SQL databases require a predefined schema, which specifies the structure of data.

schema is a logical container that defines the structure of the database — what tables exist, what columns they have, what types of data they store, and how they are related.

id INT PRIMARY KEY
name VARCHAR(50)
age INT

5) Data Integrity Constraints:Enforces rules like NOT NULL, UNIQUE, PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, CHECK.

6) Support for TransactionsMultiple operations can be grouped into a transaction that is either fully executed or rolled back.

7) Normalized Data:Data is typically normalized to reduce redundancy and improve consistency.

8) Scalability:Vertical scaling (more CPU/RAM) is commonly used. Horizontal scaling is limited compared to NoSQL.

9) Concurrency Control:SQL databases handle multiple users by implementing locks and concurrency protocols.
