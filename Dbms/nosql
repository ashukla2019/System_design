NoSQL Database Characteristics:
BASE: The "Anti-ACID" Model (used in many NoSQL systems)
BASE Property	            Description
Basically Available	      System guarantees availability, even during failures
Soft state	               System state may change over time, even without input (due to eventual consistency)
Eventually consistent	    Data becomes consistent over time, not instantly

1) Non-relational/Schema-less:NoSQL databases do not require fixed schemas—you can store unstructured, semi-structured, 
   or structured data.Fields can vary from one document to another (in document stores like MongoDB).

2) High Scalability (Horizontal Scaling)
   Designed to scale out by adding more servers (nodes), unlike SQL databases that primarily scale up.

3) High Availability and Partition Tolerance (CAP theorem)
   Often prefer Availability + Partition    Tolerance, possibly at the cost of  Consistency.

4) Support for Big Data and Real-Time Apps

Excellent for handling large volumes of data, high-velocity reads/writes, and real-time analytics.

5) Variety of Data Models:
 NoSQL includes different types of databases:
 Document-based (e.g., MongoDB)
 Key-Value stores (e.g., Redis, DynamoDB)
 Column-family (e.g., Cassandra, HBase)
 Graph-based (e.g., Neo4j)

6) Flexible Data Types and Storage
  Can store JSON, XML, binary, blobs, etc.
  Eventual Consistency (in many systems)

Data changes may take time to propagate to all nodes. (Not strictly ACID, but can be BASE: Basically Available, Soft state, Eventually consistent.)
Built-in Sharding and Replication
Automatic data distribution across nodes and support for data redundancy.

Supported Operations in NoSQL (Vary by Type)
Here’s a general mapping of operations across common NoSQL types:

Operation Type	Description	Examples
Create
Read
Update
Delete

Common Data Operations by NoSQL Type
🔹 Document Store (MongoDB, Couchbase)
   Store JSON-like documents
   Queries via BSON/JSON query language
   Supports indexes, aggregation pipelines
   Good for hierarchical data

🔹 Key-Value Store (Redis, DynamoDB)
   Simple GET/SET by key
   Extremely fast
   Ideal for caching, session storage

🔹 Column Store (Cassandra, HBase)
   Rows with dynamic columns grouped into         column families 
   Great for time-series and write-heavy apps

🔹 Graph DB (Neo4j, ArangoDB)
   Store entities as nodes, relationships as edges
   Graph queries like traversals, shortest path
   Used in social networks, recommendation systems
