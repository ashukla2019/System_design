OSI 7-Layer Model with Protocol Examples
Layer	 Name	             Purpose	                                                                    Examples of Protocols
7	   Application	     Interface for applications to access network s)ervices	                         HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, DNS, SMTP, POP3, IMAP, SNMP
6	   Presentation	     Data translation(application to network format, encryption, and compression	   SSL, TLS, JPEG, GIF, MPEG, ASCII, EBCDIC
5	   Session	         Manages sessions and connections	                                               NetBIOS, PPTP, RPC, SOCKS
4	   Transport	       End-to-end communication, reliability, flow control	                           TCP, UDP, SCTP
3	   Network	         Logical addressing and routing	                                                 IP, ICMP, IGMP, IPsec
2	   Data Link	       Physical addressing and error detection	Ethernet,                              PPP, ARP, HDLC, MAC
1	   Physical	         Transmission of raw bit streams over physical medium	                           Ethernet cables, fiber optics, Wi-Fi (physical layer), DSL

Where Does SSL/TLS Fit?
TLS/SSL is often described as being between Layers 4 and 7:
It encrypts data (Layer 6 - Presentation).
Manages sessions (Layer 5 - Session).
Operates above TCP (Layer 4) and below HTTP (Layer 7).


Where Does TCP/IP Fit?
The TCP/IP model has only 4 layers, which roughly correspond to the OSI model:

TCP/IP Layer	            Comparable OSI Layers	           Example Protocols
Application	              5, 6, 7	                         HTTP, SMTP, DNS, FTP
Transport	                4	                               TCP, UDP
Internet	                3	                               IP, ICMP, IGMP
Link (Network Access)	    1, 2	                           Ethernet,ARP, Wi-Fi, PPP


TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)
Web Browsing: When you visit a website, your browser uses TCP to ensure that all the data (HTML, CSS, images, etc.) 
is delivered in the correct order and without any missing or corrupted information. 
Email: TCP is used for sending and receiving emails, ensuring that the message and any attachments are delivered 
reliably and without errors. 
File Transfer Protocol (FTP): FTP relies on TCP to transfer files between computers, guaranteeing that the entire 
file is transferred correctly and without any data corruption. 

UDP (User Datagram Protocol)
Voice over IP (VoIP): Applications like Skype and WhatsApp use UDP for voice calls, allowing for real-time 
communication even if some packets are lost. 
Online Gaming:UDP is used in online multiplayer games to ensure fast and low-latency communication between players, 
even if some data loss occurs. 
Streaming Media:
Services like YouTube, Netflix, and Spotify use UDP for streaming video and audio, allowing for quicker data 
delivery even if some data loss occurs. 
Domain Name System (DNS):
DNS uses UDP to resolve domain names (like google.com) into IP addresses, providing fast lookup times.
