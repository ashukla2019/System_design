OSI 7-Layer Model with Protocol Examples
Layer	 Name	             Purpose	                                                     Examples of Protocols
7	   Application	     Interface for applications to access network services	       HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, DNS, SMTP, POP3, IMAP, SNMP
6	   Presentation	     Data translation, encryption, and compression	               SSL, TLS, JPEG, GIF, MPEG, ASCII, EBCDIC
5	   Session	         Manages sessions and connections	                             NetBIOS, PPTP, RPC, SOCKS
4	   Transport	       End-to-end communication, reliability, flow control	         TCP, UDP, SCTP
3	   Network	         Logical addressing and routing	                               IP, ICMP, IGMP, IPsec
2	   Data Link	       Physical addressing and error detection	Ethernet,            PPP, ARP, HDLC, MAC
1	   Physical	         Transmission of raw bit streams over physical medium	         Ethernet cables, fiber optics, Wi-Fi (physical layer), DSL

Where Does SSL/TLS Fit?
TLS/SSL is often described as being between Layers 4 and 7:
It encrypts data (Layer 6 - Presentation).
Manages sessions (Layer 5 - Session).
Operates above TCP (Layer 4) and below HTTP (Layer 7).


Where Does TCP/IP Fit?
The TCP/IP model has only 4 layers, which roughly correspond to the OSI model:

TCP/IP Layer	            Comparable OSI Layers	           Example Protocols
Application	              5, 6, 7	                         HTTP, SMTP, DNS, FTP
Transport	                4	                               TCP, UDP
Internet	                3	                               IP, ICMP, IGMP
Link (Network Access)	    1, 2	                           Ethernet,ARP, Wi-Fi, PPP
