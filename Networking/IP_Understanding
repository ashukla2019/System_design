1. What is an IP? (Internet Protocol Address)
An IP address is a unique identifier for a device on a network.
It works like a home address—allows devices to send/receive data.

Purpose:
Identify a device
Provide routing information

Two major versions:
IPv4 (older, widely used)
IPv6 (newer, larger address space)

2. IPv4 vs IPv6 — Differences
➤ IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4)

32-bit address
Written in decimal
Format: x.x.x.x
Example: 192.168.1.10
Total addresses: 4.3 billion
------------------------------------
➤ IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6)

128-bit address
Written in hexadecimal
Format: xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx
Example: fe80:0:0:0:abcd:1234:5678:9abc
Total addresses: 3.4 × 10³⁸ (effectively unlimited)
--------------------------------------------------------------
Key Differences Table
Feature	IPv4	IPv6
Address size	32-bit	128-bit
Format	Decimal (0–255)	Hexadecimal
Example	192.168.1.1	fe80::1
Total addresses	4.3 billion	340 undecillion
Header size	20 bytes	40 bytes
Security	Optional (IPSec)	Built-in IPSec
NAT	Common	Not required
Broadcast	Uses broadcast	No broadcast (uses multicast)
Autoconfig	Uses DHCP	Built-in SLAAC

------------------------------------------------------------------
3. What is a Subnet?
A subnet (sub-network) is a smaller network created inside a large network.

Why subnet?
✔ Better IP address management
✔ Increases network security
✔ Reduces broadcast traffic
✔ Organizes departments (HR, IT, Finance, etc.)

Example:
192.168.1.0/24 can be split into two subnets:
192.168.1.0/25
192.168.1.128/25
---------------------------------------------------------------------
4. What is Subnet Mask?
A subnet mask tells which part of an IP is network and which part is host.

IPv4 Example
IP:         192.168.1.10
Subnet Mask:255.255.255.0

255 values indicate network portion
0 values indicate host portion

Meaning:
Network: 192.168.1.x
Host: from 1 to 254
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
5. CIDR Notation (Classless Inter-Domain Routing)
Short way to write subnet mask.

Examples:
CIDR	Subnet Mask
/8	255.0.0.0
/16	255.255.0.0
/24	255.255.255.0
/32	1 IP (single host)

Example:
192.168.1.10/24


Means:
24 bits = network part
8 bits = host part
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
6. Network Address, Broadcast Address, Host Range

For 192.168.1.0/24:
Network: 192.168.1.0
Broadcast: 192.168.1.255
Host Range: 192.168.1.1 → 192.168.1.254
Network & broadcast are reserved, cannot be used by devices.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
7. Public vs Private IP Addresses
Private IP

Used inside LAN (local network).
Cannot be accessed from internet.

Ranges:
10.0.0.0 – 10.255.255.255
172.16.0.0 – 172.31.255.255
192.168.0.0 – 192.168.255.255

Example: home Wi-Fi uses 192.168.x.x
Public IP
Used on the Internet.
Unique and globally routable.
Example: 52.31.114.5
---------------------------------------------
8. Static vs Dynamic IP
Static IP
Manually assigned
Never changes
Used by servers, printers, routers

Dynamic IP
Assigned by DHCP server
Changes when the device reconnects
Used by normal devices like phones/laptops
-----------------------------------------------------
9. NAT (Network Address Translation)
Allows many private IP devices to use one public IP.
Used in routers.
Without NAT → IPv4 would be exhausted long ago.
----------------------------------------------------------------
10. DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)

Automatically assigns:
IP address
Subnet mask
Gateway
DNS
Lease time

Example process:
Device sends DHCP Discover
Server replies Offer
Device Requests the IP

Server sends Acknowledgement
----------------------------------------------------------------------
11. Gateway (Router)

A gateway is a device that connects your network to another network (usually the Internet).
Example:

Default Gateway: 192.168.1.1
All traffic to outside network is forwarded here.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
12. DNS (Domain Name System)

Converts domain names ↔ IP addresses.
Example:
google.com → 142.250.72.238

Humans use names; computers use IPs.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
13. ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)

Used for diagnostics.
Commands:
ping (checks connectivity)
traceroute (path tracking)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
14. ARP & NDP
ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) — IPv4

Maps IP → MAC address
NDP (Neighbor Discovery Protocol) — IPv6
Replaces ARP, DHCP, ICMP Router Discovery
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Quick Summary (Easy Revision)
Concept	Meaning
IP	Address for each device
IPv4	32-bit, 4 billion addresses
IPv6	128-bit, huge space
Subnet	Small network inside bigger network
Subnet Mask	Divides network vs host
CIDR	Short mask notation (/24)
Private IP	LAN-only
Public IP	Internet-facing
