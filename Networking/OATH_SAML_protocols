 OAuth (Open Authorization)
Use Case: Grants third-party apps access to a user's resources without exposing passwords.

Example: A calendar app uses OAuth to access your Google Calendar.

Components:

Resource Owner: The user.

Client: The app requesting access.

Authorization Server: Issues tokens (e.g., Google, GitHub).

Resource Server: API/resource provider (e.g., Google Calendar API).

Does not handle authentication directly, though OpenID Connect (OIDC) builds on OAuth for that.

ðŸ“Œ SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language)
Use Case: Enterprise Single Sign-On (SSO).

Example: A corporate user logs into Salesforce via Microsoft Azure AD.

Components:

Identity Provider (IdP): Authenticates the user (e.g., Azure AD).

Service Provider (SP): The app the user wants to access (e.g., Salesforce).

SAML Assertion: XML document with user identity and attributes, digitally signed.
