What is Networking?
Networking is the process of connecting two or more devices (computers, servers, IoT devices, etc.) to communicate and share resources (like data, files, or internet access) using wired or wireless connections.

-----------------------------------
How Networking Works — Layer by Layer (OSI Model)
Networking follows the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model — a 7-layer conceptual model describing how data moves from a sender to a receiver.

1. Application Layer
Purpose: Provides network services to user applications.

Sender Side: Converts user data (like an email, web page request) into messages.

Receiver Side: Receives the message and displays to user.

Protocols:

HTTP/HTTPS → Web browsing

SMTP, POP3, IMAP → Email

DNS → Domain name resolution

FTP, SFTP → File transfer

2. Presentation Layer
Purpose: Formats, encrypts, and compresses data before sending.

Sender Side: Converts data into a format suitable for transmission (e.g., encryption, JPEG, MP4, SSL).

Receiver Side: Decrypts, decompresses, and formats it back.

Protocols: SSL/TLS, MIME, JPEG, MP3, MPEG

3. Session Layer
Purpose: Manages sessions or connections between applications.

Sender Side: Establishes and maintains the connection.

Receiver Side: Terminates the connection after communication.

Protocols: NetBIOS, RPC, PPTP

4. Transport Layer
Purpose: Provides end-to-end communication, reliability, and segmentation.

Sender Side: Breaks data into segments and adds headers with source/destination ports.

Receiver Side: Reassembles data and ensures reliability.

Protocols:

TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) – Reliable, ordered (e.g., web, email)

UDP (User Datagram Protocol) – Fast, no guarantee (e.g., video streaming, DNS)

5.Network Layer
Purpose: Determines the best path for data (routing).
Sender Side: Adds logical addresses (IP addresses) and creates packets.

Receiver Side: Uses IP to deliver packets to correct destination.

Protocols: IP (IPv4/IPv6), ICMP, ARP, RIP, OSPF, BGP

Devices: Router

6. Data Link Layer
Purpose: Transfers data between directly connected nodes.

Sender Side: Adds MAC addresses, frames the packets.

Receiver Side: Uses MAC to identify the device and passes the frame to upper layers.

Protocols: Ethernet, PPP, HDLC, Frame Relay

Devices: Switch, Bridge

7. Physical Layer
Purpose: Transmits raw bits (0s and 1s) over physical media.

Sender Side: Converts frames into signals.

Receiver Side: Converts signals back to bits.

Protocols: Ethernet (physical part), RS-232, DSL, Wi-Fi (802.11)

Devices: Hub, Repeater, Cables, NIC

Networking Devices and Their Uses
Device	    OSI       Layer	Function
Hub	       Physical	 Broadcasts signals to all  devices
Switch	  Data Link	Connects devices within LAN using MAC addresses
Router	  Network. 	Connects different networks using IP
Bridge	  Data Link	Divides large LAN into smaller segments
Gateway	 All layers	Connects different network architectures
Repeater 	Physical	  Boosts weak signals
Access Point	Data Link	Connects wireless devices to a wired network
Firewall	  Network/Transport	Controls incoming and outgoing traffic

------------------------------------
IP Address Structure
IPv4 Address:
32 bits = 4 octets (e.g., 192.168.1.10)

Divided into:

Network ID: Identifies the network/subnet

Host ID: Identifies the device (host) in that network

Example:
For 192.168.1.10/24

Network ID → 192.168.1.0

Host ID → .10

Subnet mask → 255.255.255.0

All hosts in same subnet share same network ID, but unique host IDs.

--------------------------------------
IP Address Classes
Class	Range	Default Subnet Mask	Network/Host Split	Usage
A	1.0.0.0 – 126.255.255.255	255.0.0.0	N.H.H.H	Large networks
B	128.0.0.0 – 191.255.255.255	255.255.0.0	N.N.H.H	Medium networks
C	192.0.0.0 – 223.255.255.255	255.255.255.0	N.N.N.H	Small networks
D	224.0.0.0 – 239.255.255.255	–	Multicasting	
E	240.0.0.0 – 255.255.255.255	–	Research/Experimental	
Note: Private IP ranges:

Class A: 10.0.0.0 – 10.255.255.255

Class B: 172.16.0.0 – 172.31.255.255

Class C: 192.168.0.0 – 192.168.255.255

Summary of Data Flow (Sender → Receiver)
Sender Side:
Application Data
 ↓
Application Layer (Protocols)
 ↓
Transport Layer → TCP/UDP Segment
 ↓
Network Layer → IP Packet
 ↓
Data Link Layer → Frame (MAC added)
 ↓
Physical Layer → Bits (sent over wire)

Receiver Side (Reverse):
Bits → Frame → Packet → Segment → Data
Would you like me to draw a layer-wise diagram showing sender to receiver data flow (with headers at each step)? It makes understanding much clearer visually.

--------------------------------------

Encapsulation Process (Sender Side)
Each layer adds its own header before passing data to the next layer:

Layer	Unit	Example Header
Application	Data	HTTP Header
Transport	Segment	TCP/UDP Header (Port numbers)
Network	Packet	IP Header (Source & Destination IP)
Data Link	Frame	MAC Header (Source & Destination MAC)
Physical	Bits	Electrical / Optical signals
🔁 Decapsulation Process (Receiver Side)
The reverse process — each layer removes its header and passes the remaining data up the stack until the application receives the original.
