🌐 What Is Networking?
Networking is the practice of connecting computers and devices together so they can communicate, share data, and use shared resources (like printers, files, or the internet).

Think of it like how humans communicate — networks let machines do that.

🧩 1. Core Concept: How Networking Works
At the heart of networking lies this idea:

“Data is sent from one computer to another over a medium (wire/cable/wireless), following certain rules called protocols.”

Let’s break this down 👇

🔸 Step 1: Communication Between Devices
Every device (computer, phone, server) on a network has a Network Interface Card (NIC) — like your device’s “communication port.”
The NIC sends and receives data as electrical, optical, or radio signals.

🔸 Step 2: Medium of Communication
Devices can connect via:

Wired (Ethernet, fiber)

Wireless (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, cellular)

🔸 Step 3: Data Is Broken into Packets
When you send a message (say, visiting a website), the data is divided into small packets (tiny chunks).
Each packet travels independently and may take different routes to reach the destination.

🔸 Step 4: Protocols Manage Communication
Protocols are like rules or languages computers agree to use.
Examples:

Ethernet → Defines how data is transmitted over cables.

IP (Internet Protocol) → Defines addressing and routing.

TCP/UDP → Defines reliable/unreliable data delivery.

HTTP/HTTPS, FTP, DNS → Application-level communication.

🧱 2. OSI Model (7 Layers of Networking)
Networking is organized in layers for easier design and troubleshooting:

Layer	Name	Function	Examples
7	Application	User interaction	HTTP, FTP, DNS
6	Presentation	Data format, encryption	SSL, JPEG, ASCII
5	Session	Manages sessions	API sessions, authentication
4	Transport	End-to-end communication	TCP, UDP
3	Network	Logical addressing & routing	IP, ICMP
2	Data Link	Physical addressing	Ethernet, MAC
1	Physical	Hardware transmission	Cables, Wi-Fi, fiber
💡 Remember:

Layers 1–4 handle data delivery

Layers 5–7 handle application interaction

🧮 3. IP Addressing (IPv4)
What Is an IP Address?
An IP address uniquely identifies a device on a network.

Example:
192.168.1.10

It’s like your home address — tells where to send data.

IPv4 Format
IPv4 = 32 bits → written as 4 numbers (0–255) separated by dots.

Each number = 8 bits (1 byte)

Binary: 11000000.10101000.00000001.00001010
Decimal: 192.168.1.10
So total = 32 bits = 4 × 8 bytes.

Structure of IPv4 Address
Part	Description	Example
Network ID	Identifies the network	192.168.1
Host ID	Identifies device in that network	.10
Together → 192.168.1.10

🏷️ 4. IP Classes (Old but important for interviews)
Class	Range	Default Subnet Mask	Purpose
A	1.0.0.0 – 126.255.255.255	255.0.0.0	Very large networks
B	128.0.0.0 – 191.255.255.255	255.255.0.0	Medium networks
C	192.0.0.0 – 223.255.255.255	255.255.255.0	Small networks
D	224.0.0.0 – 239.255.255.255	N/A	Multicasting
E	240.0.0.0 – 255.255.255.255	N/A	Research/Experimental
🧮 5. Subnetting
Subnetting divides one large network into smaller networks (subnets).

Example:

Network: 192.168.1.0/24
Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0
Here /24 means → 24 bits are for network, 8 bits left for host.

Total hosts = 2⁸ - 2 = 254 hosts (network & broadcast addresses reserved).

If you split /24 into /25:

Two subnets → 192.168.1.0/25 & 192.168.1.128/25

Each supports 126 hosts.

✅ Used for better security, efficient IP allocation, and routing.

🔁 6. Routing
When a packet’s destination IP is not in the local network, it is sent to the default gateway (router).
The router decides the best path to reach the destination network.

Each router maintains a routing table — like a map showing next hops for networks.

⚙️ 7. Protocols Overview
Protocol	Purpose
ARP	Maps IP → MAC
ICMP	Error reporting (ping)
TCP	Reliable, ordered transmission
UDP	Faster, no guarantee
DNS	Domain name → IP
HTTP/HTTPS	Web communication
DHCP	Auto-assign IP addresses
NAT	Converts private IP ↔ public IP for internet access
🔐 8. Private vs Public IP
Type	Range	Usage
Private	10.0.0.0–10.255.255.255, 172.16.0.0–172.31.255.255, 192.168.0.0–192.168.255.255	Used within LAN
Public	All others	Used on internet
Private IPs can’t access the internet directly — they use NAT (Network Address Translation) via a router.

📶 9. DNS (Domain Name System)
When you type google.com, your system:

Asks DNS server: “What’s the IP of google.com?”

DNS replies: “142.250.190.14”

Browser connects to that IP via HTTP/HTTPS.

DNS acts like a phonebook of the internet.

🔐 10. TCP vs UDP
Feature	TCP	UDP
Reliability	Reliable (acknowledgments, retransmissions)	Unreliable
Order	Ordered packets	No order
Speed	Slower	Faster
Examples	HTTP, FTP, SSH	DNS, Video Streaming, VoIP
⚡ 11. How Internet Communication Happens (Step-by-Step)
When you visit https://example.com:

Your browser uses DNS → gets IP.

TCP connection established (3-way handshake).

HTTP request sent → “GET /index.html”

Server sends HTTP response.

Data packets move through routers using IP routing.

Packets arrive, TCP reassembles them in correct order.

Browser displays webpage.

🧠 12. Key Networking Devices
Device	Function
Switch	Connects devices in same network (Layer 2)
Router	Connects different networks (Layer 3)
Hub	Broadcasts to all devices (no intelligence)
Firewall	Controls traffic flow based on rules
Access Point	Provides wireless connectivity
🧩 13. CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing)
CIDR replaces old class system.

192.168.10.0/28 → subnet mask = 255.255.255.240
32 - 28 = 4 bits for host → 2⁴ - 2 = 14 hosts

Used for efficient IP usage.
