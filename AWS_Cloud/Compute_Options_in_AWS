EC2 instances are a fundamental way to run virtual servers on AWS, there are several other compute options in AWS depending
on your needsâ€”whether you want 
1) more abstraction, 
2) less management overhead, or 
3) specialized environments.

Here are some popular alternatives to EC2 instances on AWS:
1. AWS Lambda (Serverless Computing)
Run your code without managing servers.

Automatically scales.
Ideal for event-driven workloads, microservices, APIs.

You pay only for the compute time you consume.

No OS-level access; you just upload functions.

2. AWS Fargate (Serverless Containers)
Run containers without managing servers or clusters.
Works with Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service) and Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service).
You focus on containers, AWS manages the infrastructure.

3. Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service)
Managed container orchestration service.
Runs containers on a cluster of EC2 instances or using Fargate (serverless).
You manage the cluster or use Fargate to avoid managing infrastructure.

4. Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)
Managed Kubernetes service.
You can run Kubernetes clusters on EC2 instances or Fargate.
Great if you want Kubernetes orchestration without managing the control plane.

5. AWS Elastic Beanstalk
Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS).
Automatically handles deployment, capacity provisioning, load balancing, and monitoring.
Supports several platforms (Java, .NET, PHP, Node.js, Python, Ruby, Go).
You upload your code, Elastic Beanstalk manages the rest.

6. AWS Outposts
Run AWS infrastructure and services on-premises.
For hybrid cloud setups.
You get AWS hardware in your own data center.

7. AWS Batch
Fully managed batch processing at any scale.
Automatically provisions compute resources, including EC2 and Spot Instances.

8. Lightsail
Simplified VPS service.
Easy to set up and manage.
Good for simple web apps, blogs, or development environments.
