Docker — Containerization Platform
🔹 What Docker Does:
Docker lets you:Package your app + dependencies into a container image. Run the container anywhere (local, test, or production).Ensure consistency — "works on my machine" issue solved

Docker Workflow (in correct order):
1) Write a Dockerfile → defines how your app should be built (base image, dependencies, commands).

2) Build a Docker Image → docker build -t myapp . creates an image from the Dockerfile.

3) Run a Docker Container → docker run -d -p 8080:80 myapp starts a running instance of that image.

4) Docker Engine → is the core service that builds and runs containers using the image.

🧠 Think of Docker as:
“How to build and run one containerized app.”

☸️ Kubernetes — Container Orchestration Platform
🔹 What Kubernetes Does:
Once you have many containers running (using Docker or other runtimes), Kubernetes helps to:
Deploy containers to multiple servers
Scale them up/down automatically
Load balance traffic between them
Restart crashed containers
Roll out updates safely

Manage networking, storage, secrets, and configs

🔹 Core Components:
Component     	Purpose
Pod	           Smallest deployable unit — one or more containers
Node	          Physical/virtual machine running pods
Cluster      	 Collection of nodes managed by Kubernetes
Deployment	    Defines how many pods to run and update strategy
Service.      	Exposes pods to network/load balancing
Ingress.      	Manages external access (HTTP/HTTPS)
kubectl	Command-line tool to interact with cluster

🧠 Think of Kubernetes as:
“How to run and manage hundreds of containers reliably.”

----------------------------------------
⚙️ How They Work Together
Docker and Kubernetes are complementary, not competitors:

You use Docker to build and package applications into containers.

You use Kubernetes to run, schedule, and manage those containers across many machines.

Example Workflow:
Developer writes code → creates Dockerfile

Build image → push to Docker Hub (registry)

Kubernetes pulls the image → creates pods → runs them on cluster nodes
