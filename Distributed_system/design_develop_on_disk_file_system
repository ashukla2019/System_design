Designing and developing an on-disk file system like NFS (Network File System) is a complex task involving multiple layers of software engineering, from kernel modules to networking and disk I/O. Below is a high-level overview and a possible implementation plan to create a basic NFS-like on-disk file system.

1. Design Overview
Objective
Create a simple NFS-like file system that supports:

File storage on disk

Directory hierarchy

Basic file operations (create, read, write, delete)

Network file access via a simple protocol

2. Architecture
Components
Disk Layer (Filesystem)

On-disk layout: Superblock, inode table, data blocks, directory entries

Written in C/C++ and interacts directly with disk via block device or files

VFS Interface (optional for integration)

Linux kernel module for mounting the file system

NFS-like Server

Handles client requests over network (RPC or HTTP/REST)

Authenticates and routes file operations to disk layer

NFS-like Client

Mounts remote file system locally

Redirects standard file calls (open, read, write) to the server

3. On-Disk Filesystem Structure
Data Layout
| Superblock | Inode Table | Directory Table | Data Blocks |
Superblock: Metadata about the file system (block size, free blocks, etc.)

Inodes: Metadata for files (type, size, block pointers)

Directories: Mappings from file names to inode numbers

Data blocks: Raw contents of files

4. Development Plan
Phase 1: Disk-Based Filesystem
Language: C or C++

Create a file that simulates disk (disk.img)

Implement:

mkfs (format the file system)

File I/O functions: create(), read(), write(), delete()

Directory support

Phase 2: NFS-like Server
Language: Python (Flask), C++, or Go

Implements:

GET /file

POST /file

DELETE /file

Maps network calls to filesystem functions

Phase 3: NFS-like Client
Mounts remote FS via FUSE (Filesystem in Userspace)

Forwards file system calls to the NFS server

5. Tools & Libraries
FUSE (Filesystem in Userspace)

POSIX file APIs

gRPC or HTTP for RPC

C/C++ for performance-critical parts

Python/Go for rapid development of network layer

6. Example: Filesystem Metadata Structures (C)
#define BLOCK_SIZE 4096
#define MAX_FILES 1024

typedef struct {
    int magic_number;
    int total_blocks;
    int free_block_count;
    int inode_count;
} SuperBlock;

typedef struct {
    int inode_id;
    int size;
    int block_pointers[10];
    int is_directory;
} Inode;

typedef struct {
    int inode_id;
    char name[256];
} DirectoryEntry;
7. Example: Simple File Operations
int fs_create(const char* filename);
int fs_write(const char* filename, const void* data, int size);
int fs_read(const char* filename, void* buffer, int size);
int fs_delete(const char* filename);
