SQL Database Characteristics and Supported Operations
‚úÖ Characteristics of SQL Databases:

1) Relational Structure: Data is stored in tables (relations) composed of rows and columns.Tables can be linked using foreign keys to maintain referential integrity.

2) Structured Query Language (SQL):SQL is the standard language used to interact with relational databases.

3) ACID Properties:
   Atomicity: All operations in a transaction   are completed; otherwise, none are.

   Consistency: The database remains in a valid state before and after transactions.

   Isolation: Transactions do not interfere with each other.

  Durability: Once a transaction is committed, it is permanently saved.

4) Schema-Based: SQL databases require a predefined schema, which specifies the structure of data.

5) Data Integrity Constraints:Enforces rules like NOT NULL, UNIQUE, PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, CHECK.

6) Support for TransactionsMultiple operations can be grouped into a transaction that is either fully executed or rolled back.

7) Normalized Data:Data is typically normalized to reduce redundancy and improve consistency.

8) Scalability:Vertical scaling (more CPU/RAM) is commonly used. Horizontal scaling is limited compared to NoSQL.

9) Concurrency Control:SQL databases handle multiple users by implementing locks and concurrency protocols.

üõ†Ô∏è Supported SQL Operations
1. Data Definition Language (DDL)
Used to define and modify database structures:

Command	Description
CREATE	Create databases, tables, indexes, views
ALTER	Modify existing database objects
DROP	Delete database objects
TRUNCATE	Quickly remove all records from a table (no rollback)

2. Data Manipulation Language (DML)
Used to manipulate data within tables:

Command	Description
SELECT	Retrieve data
INSERT	Add new records
UPDATE	Modify existing records
DELETE	Remove records

3. Data Control Language (DCL)
Used to control access to data:

Command	Description
GRANT	Provide user access privileges
REVOKE	Remove user access privileges

4. Transaction Control Language (TCL)
Used to manage transactions:

Command	Description
BEGIN / START TRANSACTION	Begin a transaction
COMMIT	Save changes made during the transaction
ROLLBACK	Undo changes since the last commit
SAVEPOINT	Set a point within a transaction to roll back to

5. Joins and Queries
SQL supports powerful querying through:

INNER JOIN
LEFT/RIGHT JOIN
FULL OUTER JOIN
SELF JOIN
UNION / INTERSECT / EXCEPT
GROUP BY, HAVING, ORDER BY
Subqueries and nested SELECTs
