Architecture:
	Microservices: Divide the application into small, independent services, each responsible for a specific business function. 
	Three-tier Architecture: Separates the application into three layers: presentation, application, and data. 
	N-tier Architecture: An extension of three-tier, allowing for more layers and potentially more complex interactions. 

Communication:
	RPC (Remote Procedure Call): Allows services to call each other's functions, typically over a network. 
	Messaging: Uses message queues or brokers for asynchronous communication between services. 
	
State Management:
	Caches: Store frequently accessed data to improve performance. 
	Replication: Duplicate data across multiple servers for fault tolerance and load balancing. 
	Database Design: Choose appropriate database technologies and designs (e.g., distributed databases, sharding). 

Consistency:
	Eventual Consistency: Allow for slight delays in data updates to improve performance. 
	Strong Consistency: Ensure data is up-to-date across all nodes, which may impact performance. 
	2PC (Two-Phase Commit): A protocol for coordinating transactions across multiple services to ensure atomicity. 
	
Reliability and Scalability:
	Load Balancing: Distribute traffic across multiple servers to prevent overload. 
	Circuit Breaker Pattern: Prevent failures in one service from cascading to other services. 
	Idempotency: Ensure that repeated requests have the same effect as the first request. 
	
Monitoring and Logging:
	Metrics: Collect data on system health and performance. 
	Logging: Log events for debugging and analysis. 

Common Design Patterns:
	Sidecar Pattern: Deploy a sidecar container alongside the main application container to handle tasks like logging, configuration, and service discovery. 
	Ambassador Pattern: Use a dedicated service to route requests to different backend services, offering load balancing and other functionalities. 
	Adapter Pattern: Translate requests between different systems or services. 
	
Tools and Technologies:
	Containerization (Docker): Pack application components into containers for easy deployment and management. 
	Orchestration (Kubernetes): Automate the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. 
	Messaging (Kafka, RabbitMQ): Facilitate asynchronous communication between services. 
	
Challenges:
	Increased Complexity: Managing a distributed system can be more complex than managing a monolithic application. 
	Data Consistency: Ensuring data consistency across multiple nodes can be challenging. 
	Network Latency: Communication across a network introduces latency, which can impact performance.
