Proxy (Forward Proxy): A proxy server sits between the client and the internet. 
It acts on behalf of the client.

How it works:
The client sends a request to the proxy.
The proxy forwards the request to the destination server.
The response is sent back through the proxy to the client.

Use cases:
Anonymity: Hides client IP addresses.
Content filtering: E.g., blocking certain websites in an organization.
Caching: Speeds up access to frequently requested content.
Access control: Restricting what users can access.

Example:
A company uses a proxy so employees can access the internet but block social media and log activity.

Reverse Proxy:A reverse proxy sits in front of web servers, acting as an intermediary on behalf of the server.
How it works:
The client sends a request to the reverse proxy.
The reverse proxy decides which backend server should handle it.
The response goes back through the reverse proxy to the client.

Use cases:
Load balancing: Distributes traffic among servers.
SSL termination: Handles SSL encryption/decryption.
Caching: Speeds up response time.
Security: Hides internal server details, mitigates DDoS attacks.

Example:
Netflix uses a reverse proxy to route traffic to various microservices behind the scenes.
